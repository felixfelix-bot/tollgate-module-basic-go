# Changelog

All notable changes to the TollGate basic module are documented here.
This project loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/)
and [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

> **Note:** Releases prior to `v0.4.0` predate this changelog and were not
> documented. The entries below cover everything merged into `main` since the
> `v0.4.0` tag.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Deterministic network identity: NIP-06 + HKDF + RevealSeed.** New
  `src/identity` package deriving a router's network identity from the
  merchant key: a stable IPv4 in the RFC 6598 CGNAT range (.1 host),
  per-interface locally-administered MACs, root and Wi-Fi passwords
  (6-word BIP39), and a 12-word NIP-06 mnemonic
  (m/44'/1237'/0'/0/0) with a recovery flow via `DeriveFromMnemonic`.
  Derivations use HKDF (RFC 5869) with per-attribute domain
  separation instead of raw hash concatenation. New additive HTTP
  API: `GET /identity` (non-sensitive npub/IPv4/MACs) and
  `POST /identity/reveal-seed`, which returns the key and derived
  passwords and is loopback-only, POST-only, and body-size limited.
  The routes degrade gracefully (not registered) when
  `identities.json` is missing or malformed
  ([#331](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/331)).

- **Backend API firewall: port 2121 restricted to LAN interfaces.**
  New nftables include (`30-backend-firewall.nft`) blocks the backend
  API from non-br-lan interfaces (loopback allowed). WiFi clients
  still reach the payment endpoint via NDS users_to_router rules.
  WAN-side and upstream clients can no longer directly probe the
  backend API. Defense-in-depth for #226 — does not change the listen
  address or payment flow
  ([#345](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/345)).

- **Post-payment redirect with configurable auth delay.** New
  `auth_delay_seconds` and `redirect_url` fields in the upstream Wi-Fi
  configuration let the captive portal show a welcome page before the
  gate opens: the valve schedules `ndsctl auth` after the configured
  delay in a goroutine that is cancellable via `Stop()`/`CloseGate()`.
  Ships a `welcome.html` landing page; the default of `0` keeps the
  previous immediate-auth behavior
  ([#200](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/200)).

### Fixed

- **Spending condition validation: reject P2PK/HTLC-locked tokens.**
  `tollwallet.Receive()` now checks each proof's secret for spending
  conditions before crediting the user. Tokens with P2PK or HTLC locks
  are rejected with `ErrLockedToken`, preventing an attacker from
  getting free internet access with tokens the gateway can never spend.
  Found during cashu-audit Layer 3 audit. Fixes #324.

- **Fund() token decode: use generic DecodeToken instead of V4-only.**
  `merchant.Fund()` called `cashu.DecodeTokenV4()` (V4-only, no V3
  fallback). Changed to `cashu.DecodeToken()` which tries V4 then V3.
  Fixes #325.

- **V2 keyset swap crash — gonuts-tollgate v0.7.4 → v0.7.6.** V2
  keyset IDs (33 bytes) were silently truncated to 8 bytes in the
  NUT-13 deterministic derivation path, producing a wrong secret
  path — every swap against CDK 0.16+ mints with V2-only keysets
  failed with "outputs have already been signed before." v0.7.6
  hashes V2 keyset IDs before deriving the path; V1 IDs keep the
  original behavior (NUT-13 test vectors unchanged). Also adds a
  Cashu compatibility matrix (V3/V4 tokens × V1/V2 keysets) with
  round-trip tests and `docs/cashu-compatibility-matrix.md`.
  Fixes #176, fixes #257
  ([#281](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/281)).

- **V4 short keyset ID resolution — gonuts-tollgate v0.8.0.** V4 CBOR
  short keyset IDs (8 bytes) are now resolved to full V2 keyset IDs
  before swap requests are sent, fixing "NUT02: ID length invalid"
  on V4+V2 token payments. Verified against V4+V1, V3+V1, and V3+V2
  control cases
  ([#286](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/286)).

- **Mint HTTP 429 error mapping.** When a Cashu mint returns 429
  (rate limit), the error code is now `mint-rate-limited` with a
  user-friendly message instead of generic
  `payment-processing-failed`. Gonuts v0.10.0 handles retry internally
  ([#260](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/issues/260)).

- **Cashu wallet swap-counter race (critical).** Bump `gonuts-tollgate`
  from v0.7.1 to v0.7.4 to pick up the fix for an unrecoverable
  "blinded message already signed" error (NUT-02 code 10002). In v0.7.1
  the keyset counter was incremented only after a successful swap, so
  a transient mint failure (timeout, DNS hiccup, 5xx) left the counter
  stuck — every retry reused the same counter, the mint rejected with
  10002, and the wallet bricked permanently with no self-recovery.
  v0.7.4 increments the counter before the swap call and adds a
  `swapWithRetry` path that regenerates fresh blinded messages on
  retry.

- **Mint URL fuzzy matching in `calculateAllotment()`.** The mint URL
  from Cashu tokens was compared against configured accepted mints
  using exact string equality (`==`), causing payments to fail when
  the URL differed by a trailing slash, uppercase host, or path
  normalization. `calculateAllotment()` now uses the existing
  `tollwallet.MintURLMatches()` function which tolerates these
  differences — the same function already used by the wallet layer
  during `Receive()`
  ([#250](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/issues/250),
  [#251](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/issues/251)).

- **Lightning quote persistence across restarts.** Lightning invoice
  quotes are now persisted to disk (`quotes.json` in the wallet
  directory) so they survive process restarts. Previously all pending
  quotes were stored in-memory only; when `tollgate-wrt` restarted
  (deploy, config change, or crash), users who had already paid saw the
  portal stuck on "Waiting for payment" because the backend returned
  `lightning quote not found`. On startup, persisted quotes are loaded,
  expired/settled ones are pruned, and monitoring goroutines are
  relaunched for unpaid quotes so access is granted if the invoice was
  settled while the process was down
  ([#248](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/248)).

- **Lightning quote persistence: data race + crash-safety fix.**
  `persistLightningQuotes` now deep-copies `lightningQuoteRecord`
  values under the `RLock` instead of sharing pointers — eliminates a
  data race where `saveQuotes` read mutable fields
  (`SessionGranted`, `Allotment`, `CompletedAt`) from shared pointers
  after the lock was released. `saveQuotes` now calls `tmp.Sync()`
  before `tmp.Close()` so the rename-atomicity guarantee holds on
  power-loss. Adds 5 concurrency tests as regression guards.

- **Nil-wallet panic in `GetMintQuoteState`.**
  `tollwallet.GetMintQuoteState()` returns an error instead of
  panicking when called on a nil wallet
  ([#259](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/259)).

- **Degraded mode on wallet-init failure.** When the mint is
  reachable via `/v1/info` but the keyset API returns errors, the
  merchant now falls back to degraded mode instead of crash-looping;
  a regression test covers the fallback path
  ([#298](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/298),
  [#309](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/309)).

- **NDS enforcement actually gates on fw4/nftables (OpenWrt 24.10).**
  NDS 5.0.2 inserts its enforcement chain in `ip filter FORWARD`
  (iptables-nft), but fw4's `inet fw4 forward` chain (priority 0)
  accepted forwarded traffic first — the NDS enforcement chain saw
  zero packets and authenticated clients were never actually gated.
  New `/etc/nftables.d/20-nds-enforce.nft` hooks `inet fw4 forward`
  at priority -1 and acts on the NDS marks set in mangle PREROUTING:
  pre-auth → drop, trusted/authed → accept, unmarked to WAN → reject
  (forcing the captive portal). Loaded by fw4 on boot and on firewall
  reload; survives NDS restarts. `SETUP_VERSION` bumped to `v0.5.1`
  so a reinstall triggers the full setup
  ([#283](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/283),
  [#286](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/286)).

- **Portable WAN detection in the NDS enforcement bridge.** WAN-side
  interface detection no longer assumes a fixed interface name
  ([#289](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/issues/289),
  [#297](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/297)).

- **Router-to-router usage tracking: trigger an NDS session after
  autopay.** After the downstream router's payment is accepted by the
  upstream TollGate (POST to :2121), the downstream now triggers a
  port-80 HTTP GET on the upstream so NoDogSplash creates a client
  session — without it, `ndsctl` reported no client, usage tracking
  always read 0, and the gate never closed when the allotment ran
  out. The trigger validates the upstream `GatewayIP` first,
  rejecting loopback, link-local, and unspecified addresses, so a
  malicious or corrupt advertisement cannot coax the downstream into
  probing the local box; the per-payment success log is demoted to
  `Debug` (it fires on every renewal and was noisy)
  ([#88](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/issues/88),
  [#315](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/315),
  [#347](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/347)).

- **AP setup recovery on reinstall/upgrade.** The
  `99-tollgate-setup` uci-defaults script no longer bails entirely
  when `/etc/tollgate-setup-done` exists: the flag now stores a setup
  version and wireless verification always runs, so missing APs are
  recreated on same-version reinstalls and the SSID is recovered from
  existing config for consistency. Fixes #103, fixes #173
  ([#216](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/216)).

- **`/usage` spec compliance: `200` with `-1/-1` when no session.**
  The spec requires HTTP 200 with `-1/-1` when the customer has no
  active session; the Go binary returned 500 both when the MAC lookup
  failed and when `GetUsage` errored. Both cases now match the spec
  and the Rust implementation. Found by the Go/Rust parity test
  ([#316](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/316)).

- **CORS on `/usage`.** The usage endpoint was the only HTTP route
  without `CorsMiddleware`; the handler is extracted to `HandleUsage`
  and wrapped like every other route. The kind=21000 Nostr wrapper
  token parsing from `POST /` is extracted into
  `extractCashuToken()` and covered by unit tests
  ([#195](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/195)).

- **`sat` standardization + config migration.** `price_unit` is
  standardized from `sats` to `sat` (NUT-00) across all Go files, and
  persisted `sats` values are normalized to `sat` on load, so
  deployed configs migrate in place. The migration no longer is
  skipped when `profit_share` is invalid (defaults are restored and
  the flow continues), and the advertisement now lists all configured
  mints instead of only reachable ones, so pricing tags no longer
  disappear from the captive portal when a mint flaps
  ([#310](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/310)).

- **Owner-first, recipient-fault-tolerant profit-share payouts.**
  `processPayout` is redesigned: every recipient's LNURL is probed
  first (unreachable recipients are skipped, their share stays in the
  wallet), the owner must be reachable and paid successfully before
  any dev-split payout, and reachable maintainers are paid
  independently — one maintainer being offline no longer faults the
  mint or blocks the others. Resolves #27
  ([#168](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/168)).

- **Security: TOCTOU-safe SSRF validation via custom DialContext.**
  The LNURL-payer fetch replaces `http.Get` with an `http.Client`
  that validates the resolved IP at TCP-dial time, closing the DNS
  rebinding window where validation sees a public IP and the actual
  connection dials `127.0.0.1`. Also brings the previously
  unvalidated `/.well-known/lnurlp/` fetch under the same protection
  ([#218](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/issues/218),
  [#245](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/245)).

- **Security: LNURL callback URL validation.** Callback URLs from
  Lightning Address resolution are checked for loopback, RFC 1918
  private, link-local (including the `169.254.169.254` cloud-metadata
  address), and unspecified addresses before the HTTP fetch, so a
  malicious LNURL provider cannot make the router fetch internal
  endpoints
  ([#198](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/198)).

- **Security: RFC 1918 isolation — block WiFi from upstream private
  networks.** Authenticated WiFi clients are blocked from RFC 1918
  ranges behind the upstream link at both the fw4 layer and the
  NoDogSplash authenticated_users rules, so isolation holds even if
  one layer fails
  ([#234](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/234)).

- **Security: UCI key/value validation.** `setUCIValue` rejects
  control characters (newlines, carriage returns, null bytes) in keys
  and values, preventing UCI config corruption and argument
  injection. Closes #220
  ([#222](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/222)).

- **Security: config file permissions tightened from 0644 to 0600**
  ([#221](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/221)).

- **Security: sanitized error responses.** Balance and
  Lightning-invoice JSON responses no longer echo `err.Error()` to
  clients; internal details are logged server-side only (audit
  finding S3)
  ([#177](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/issues/177),
  [#202](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/202)).

- **Security: rate limiting on the payment endpoint.** `POST /` is
  wrapped in a token-bucket limiter (10 requests/minute per IP,
  burst 10) that returns 429 with a `Retry-After` header, preventing
  DoS via invalid-token spam (audit finding S1). The limit is
  configurable via the `TOLLGATE_RATE_LIMIT_RPM` environment
  variable for busier resellers
  ([#177](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/issues/177),
  [#274](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/274),
  [#338](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/338)).

- **HTTP response body reads now limited to 1 MB.** All `io.ReadAll`
  calls on HTTP response bodies (LNURL resolve, invoice fetch, gateway
  probes, usage tracker) now use `io.LimitReader` with a 1 MB cap,
  matching the existing limit on the main payment handler. Prevents
  OOM crashes on resource-constrained routers when a malicious or
  compromised upstream service returns an oversized response
  ([#267](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/267),
  [#274](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/274)).

- **Security: dependency CVE sweep.** `golang.org/x/crypto`
  v0.38.0 → v0.54.0 and `golang.org/x/net` v0.40.0 → v0.57.0,
  clearing all 65 open Dependabot alerts (28 critical, 8 high,
  29 medium)
  ([#223](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/223)).

- **Protocol compliance: notice event codes and tips tag.** Map
  implementation-specific notice event codes to spec-defined codes from
  TIP-01 (`session-management-failed`, `gate-open-failed`, and
  `allotment-calculation-failed` → `session-error`;
  `payment-error-token-spent` already matched). Codes with no spec
  equivalent (`payment-error-invalid-token`, `invalid-mac-address`,
  `payment-processing-timeout`, `payment-processing-failed`) are kept
  as-is with precision in the content string. Also remove non-existent
  TIP-03 and TIP-04 from the advertisement `tips` tag — only TIP-01 and
  TIP-02 are defined.

- **Wireless config missing-file guard.** `scanner.GetRadios()` and
  `connector.getRadiosFromConfig()` now return gracefully when
  `/etc/config/wireless` does not exist instead of erroring every scan
  cycle
  ([#196](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/196)).
- **Dead firewall include removed.** The `firewall-tollgate` include file
  was silently rejected by fw4 (nftables); rules now created directly via
  UCI named sections with idempotent guards
  ([#196](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/196)).
- **Makefile references to deleted firewall-tollgate.** PR #196 removed
  `files/etc/config/firewall-tollgate` but two Makefile references (install
  rule + conffiles list) were left behind, breaking all package builds
  ([#235](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/issues/235),
  [#237](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/237)).
- **Upstream gateway IP validation.** Loopback, unspecified, and
  link-local addresses are now rejected in the TollGate prober to prevent
  SSRF
  ([#196](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/196)).

### Changed / Internal

- **Safe exec wrapper package.** New `src/sysexec/` package providing a
  testable `Runner` interface with context, timeout, structured logging,
  and retry support for `exec.Command` calls. Foundation for refactoring
  the 37 existing exec.Command call sites (#263). 13 tests, stdlib only
  ([#265](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/265)).

- **Operator guide.** New `docs/operator-guide.md` covering every `tollgate`
  CLI subcommand (service, wallet, private network, upstream Wi-Fi, config,
  health) with example output, flags, and a troubleshooting section; README
  modules table and documentation list updated to reflect the full CLI
  surface
  ([#188](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/188)).

- **Man pages for the full CLI.** Section-8 man pages are generated from
  the cobra command tree (hidden `__gen-man` subcommand +
  `scripts/gen-man-pages.sh`), committed under
  `packaging/files/man/man8/`, and installed to `/usr/share/man/man8/`,
  so operators can discover the CLI via `man tollgate` on the router
  ([#187](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/187)).

- **Dependency consolidation: gonuts-tollgate v0.10.0 under
  OpenTollGate.** The gonuts module is renamed
  `Origami74/gonuts-tollgate` → `OpenTollGate/gonuts-tollgate` and
  bumped to v0.10.0
  ([#304](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/304)),
  via v0.9.0 with corrected go.sum hashes
  ([#292](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/292),
  [#293](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/293));
  sub-module replace directives are aligned with the main module
  ([#194](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/194)).
  Shared dependencies are synced to the highest version used across all
  14 go.mod files (Go directive 1.25.0, go-nostr v0.51.12, x/sys, x/term,
  ln-decodepay, sonic, websocket), enforced by a new drift checker plus a
  stale-import-path checker wired into pre-commit and CI
  ([#307](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/307)).

- **Captive-portal assets are built from source.** Minified JS/CSS is no
  longer committed; `make portal-build` (packaging/portal-build.sh)
  clones the portal repo, runs `npm ci && npm run build`, and copies the
  output, with `PORTAL_REF` pinning a branch/tag/SHA. Closes #288,
  supersedes #323
  ([#335](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/335)).

- **CLI honors `TOLLGATE_TEST_CONFIG_DIR` for the socket path**, so
  parity tests and local development run unprivileged instead of
  needing root for `/var/run/tollgate.sock`
  ([#294](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/294)).

- **CI/build fixes.** NIP-94 1063 release events are published directly
  in the build step — the previous "Publish events" step piped JSON into
  `nak` and created kind-1 notes instead of publishing the pre-signed
  1063s
  ([#230](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/230));
  `GO_VERSION` bumped to 1.25 and Blossom upload errors surfaced
  ([#244](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/244));
  dangling firewall-tollgate references removed from the build workflow
  and the sysupgrade keep list
  ([#238](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/238));
  Blossom mirror list adjusted for currently-working servers
  ([#302](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/302),
  [#303](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/303)).

- **Docs.** The canonical TollGate protocol spec now lives in
  OpenTollGate/tollgate; the stale local `docs/protocol/` copy is
  deprecated and removed
  ([#236](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/236));
  the architecture decision that NoDogSplash port 2121 belongs in this
  module (not tollgate-rs) is recorded
  ([#182](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/182));
  the "never derive secrets from public keys" anti-pattern is documented
  in CONTRIBUTING.md
  ([#227](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/227)).

- **Chores.** `.gitignore` extended for agent/session working files
  (`.omo/`, planning-doc patterns)
  ([#276](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/276));
  gofmt tab-indentation fix in `migrateConfig`
  ([#319](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/319)).

## [v0.5.0] - 2026-07-03

Everything merged into `main` since `v0.4.0` (tagged 2026-04-06),
including the `v0.5.0-alpha1` through `v0.5.0-alpha3` pre-releases.
Release notes: [RELEASE-NOTES.md](RELEASE-NOTES.md).

### Added

- **Upstream WiFi management.** New manager that detects and connects to
  upstream gateways, with a startup connectivity check, TollGate-aware probing,
  and a cross-radio DHCP nudge to recover stuck links
  ([#109](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/109),
  [#122](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/122)).
- **Mint resilience.** Per-mint health tracking, try-all-mints fallback on
  payment, and automatic recovery of mints that come back online, so a single
  failing mint no longer blocks purchases
  ([#120](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/120)),
  plus aggressive mint health-check retry on startup so a router that boots
  faster than its uplink still finds its mints.
- **SSL/HTTPS management for the captive portal**, all new in this release and
  implemented in Go, with a self-signed certificate mode, hostname setup
  (`TollGate`), and captive-portal domain configuration
  ([#123](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/123)).
- **Lightning checkout and balance view** in the captive portal
  ([#107](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/107)).
- **Schema-driven configuration with a `--json` CLI.** `GetConfigSchema()` and
  dot-path get/set with validation, plus `tollgate --json config
  schema/get/set/save` (and health/wallet) commands to support admin-UI
  integration. Ships with a test workflow, schema contract lint, and a
  build-purity contract test
  ([#147](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/147)).
- **x86_64 / amd64 build target** for virtual-lab testing
  ([#80](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/80) and
  follow-ups).
- **Local OpenWrt SDK source-build helper** for reproducing package builds
  off-CI
  ([#105](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/105),
  [#79](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/79)).
- **Merchant degraded mode.** A zero-dependency `PaymentMerchant` interface
  ([#138](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/138)),
  mint health tracking with a provider and sentinel error plus USM decoupling
  ([#139](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/139)),
  and dynamic upgrade/downgrade between full and degraded operation
  ([#140](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/140)),
  surfaced through a captive-portal degraded-mode UI
  ([#141](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/141)).
- **SSL management rewritten in Go** with wrapper scripts, replacing the earlier
  shell-driven approach
  ([#142](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/142)).
- **V2 keyset ID support** for CDK 0.16.0+ compatibility
  ([#126](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/126)).

### Fixed

- **Transport reliability on OpenWrt:** force TLS 1.2 and set HTTP client
  timeouts so requests no longer hang on constrained routers
  ([#137](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/137)).
- **Security:** generate passwords with `crypto/rand` instead of time-based
  (`math/rand`) entropy
  ([#111](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/111)).
- **First-boot stability:** eliminate the reboot race, speed up `uci-defaults`,
  and unify the AP SSID
  ([#84](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/84)).
- **Install/postinst:** execute UCI defaults and reload services during
  `postinst` so a fresh install comes up correctly
  ([#90](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/90)).
- **Captive portal / HTTPS:** prevent the `uhttpd` crash loop by configuring a
  cert/key for HTTPS, keep NoDogSplash on port 80, and make the cert CN match
  the actual hostname
  ([#123](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/123)).
- **Firewall:** prevent duplicate NoDogSplash firewall rules in
  `users_to_router`
  ([#123](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/123)).
- **Packaging:** wrap the `.ipk` as a gzipped tar instead of an `ar` archive so
  it installs on stock OpenWrt
  ([#100](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/100)).
- **Payment correctness:** case-insensitive mint URL comparison, proper
  spent-token detection, valve re-auth without a stale in-memory cache, and
  trust `X-Forwarded-For` only from localhost, plus IP/MAC input validation and
  a 1 MB request-body cap
  ([#104](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/104)).
- **Merchant payout safety / valve timer race:** guard against `PricePerStep=0`
  division-by-zero, prevent a `uint64` underflow in payout, and stop a stale
  valve timer callback from deleting its replacement
  ([#161](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/161)).
- **Two-router autopay reliability:** retry `ndsctl auth` briefly in the valve
  so a payment's gate-open no longer fails on the first attempt when NoDogSplash
  has not yet registered the reseller client (previously failed with "failed to
  open gate" and recovered only via the token-recovery path ~60–90s later)
  ([#170](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/170)).
- **Wallet/mint registration:** register all accepted mints in the wallet at
  startup, and always open the gate for bytes (data-metered) sessions
  ([#167](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/167)).
- **Config migration:** fix the `config_version` `v0.0.7` → `v0.0.8` migration
  ([#174](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/issues/174))
  and the `upstream_detector` `go.mod`
  ([#172](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/issues/172))
  ([#178](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/178)).
- **BOLT11 / NoDogSplash:** make BOLT11 decode non-fatal and set the NoDogSplash
  gateway port to 2050
  ([#158](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/158)).
- **Captive-portal bypass:** disable IPv6 on the LAN during installation so
  clients cannot route around the portal
  ([#148](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/148),
  [#160](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/160)).
- **Session lifecycle:** evict expired timed sessions and start the scan loop
  ([#106](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/106)).
- **Additional security hardening and correctness guards**
  ([#163](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/163)).

### Changed / Internal

- **Default profit share:** split the 0.21 dev share across three maintainer
  identities (`c08r4d0r`, `amperstrand`, `origami74`, 0.07 each), each with its
  own Lightning address; applies to fresh default configs, existing configs are
  not rewritten
  ([#165](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/165)).
- **Release distribution:** publish redundantly to multiple relays and Blossom
  mirrors
  ([#152](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/152)),
  and list every successful Blossom mirror as a `url` tag on the NIP-94
  release events
  ([#183](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/183)).
- **CI:** split compile from package, add APK output and batched publish, native
  `.ipk` packaging with a flag-based matrix and a compression gate, and run the
  build workflow on pull requests
  ([#97](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/97),
  [#98](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/98),
  [#80](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/80)).
- Moved the `random-lan-ip` UCI default out to `tollgate-os`
  ([#96](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/96)).
- Renamed `c03rad0r` to `c08r4d0r` across the codebase
  ([#92](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/92)).
- Dead-code and docs cleanup sweep
  ([#81](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/81)).
- **CI:** replace artifact actions with Blossom + Nostr coordination
  ([#155](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/155))
  and expand the test matrix to cover standalone-buildable modules
  ([#157](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/157)).
- **CI:** skip the build/publish pipeline for fork PRs, which cannot access the
  publishing secrets
  ([#166](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/166)),
  and build an `x86_64` `.apk` variant
  ([#183](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/183)).
- **Tests:** make the root-module test hermetic via a fresh temp config dir
  (`testenv` build tag), so the suite runs off-router
  ([#169](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/issues/169),
  [#179](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/179)).
- Add `AGENTS.md` with LLM contributor rules and tighten `.gitignore` for
  planning docs
  ([#159](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/159));
  since expanded alongside the new [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and
  [PR-REVIEW.md](PR-REVIEW.md).
