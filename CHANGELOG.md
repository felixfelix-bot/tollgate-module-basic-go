# Changelog

All notable changes to the TollGate basic module are documented here.
This project loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/)
and [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

> **Note:** Releases prior to `v0.4.0` predate this changelog and were not
> documented. The entries below cover everything merged into `main` since the
> `v0.4.0` tag.

## [Unreleased]

## [v0.6.0] - 2026-08-27

### Added

- **Captive-portal uhttpd instance on port 2051.** A second uhttpd
  section (`config uhttpd portal`) now serves the SPA directly on
  `0.0.0.0:2051` / `[::]:2051`, decoupling portal serving from the
  nodogsplash pre-auth path. The NDS `users_to_router` allow list
  includes port 2051 (idempotent, mirrors the existing
  2121/8080/2050 pattern).

- **Management WiFi password in setup log.** `setup_private_network()`
  now writes the generated `private_key` to `/tmp/tollgate-setup.log`
  alongside the existing SSID and IP entries.

### Changed

- **Setup version bumped to v0.6.2.** Reinstall/upgrade now triggers a
  full setup rerun on already-deployed routers, installing the stub
  and portal instance alongside prior configuration. Existing
  management-WiFi credentials are preserved (see Fixed below).

- **Setup log restricted to root.** `/tmp/tollgate-setup.log`, which
  records the management-WiFi password, is now created with mode 600
  instead of the default 0644.

- **CI: `trigger-build-os` gated to the upstream repo.** The TollGate
  OS repository-dispatch requires `REPO_ACCESS_TOKEN` (upstream-only)
  and should never fire from fork branches; fork builds now skip the
  job instead of failing on the missing token.

### Fixed

- **Accept client MAC from request body/query.** The backend now
  accepts a `mac` field in Lightning invoice requests and Cashu payment
  requests (as a query param), and a `mac` query param for invoice
  polling and `/whoami`. This allows the splash page to pass the real
  client MAC (from nodogsplash preauth redirect) instead of relying on
  IP-based ARP/DHCP lookup that fails behind the router's reverse proxy.
  The PR #6 fallback MAC (`00:00:00:00:00:00`) is kept as a safety net
  for backward compatibility.
  ([#358](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/358))

- **All HTTP handlers now handle MAC lookup failure gracefully.**
  Previously, `handleLightningInvoicePost` (POST /ln-invoice),
  `HandleRootPost` (POST /), and `handler` (/whoami) returned 400 or
  500 when `getMacAddress` failed. They now log a warning and use a
  fallback MAC (`00:00:00:00:00:00`) instead, matching the fix already
  applied to `handleLightningInvoiceGet` (GET /ln-invoice) in the
  previous commit. `HandleUsage` and `HandleBalance` were already
  non-fatal.

- **Captive portal no longer served through nodogsplash.**
  `/etc/nodogsplash/htdocs` is no longer a symlink to the SPA. A tiny
  stub page — installed as `splash.html`, the page NDS actually serves
  pre-auth — with a JS `location.replace` to port 2051 `/splash.html`
  (plus a `<noscript>` fallback link built from the LAN IP, since NDS
  redirects clients by gateway IP) is installed instead, keeping NDS
  pre-auth responses well under 1 KB. Verified on stock NDS 5.0.2:
  clients NDS cannot map to a MAC (`ip neigh` miss) receive an NDS
  error page on every request, and internal NDS errors render as
  HTTP 500 — the SPA itself now loads from uhttpd regardless.

- **No-CIDR LAN IP in the stub fallback link.** On routers where
  `network.lan.ipaddr` holds CIDR notation (`192.168.1.1/24`, legal
  UCI since OpenWrt 21.02), the stub's `<noscript>` fallback link
  embedded the raw value, producing a malformed URL
  (`http://192.168.1.1/24:2051/…`). The JS redirect path was
  unaffected (it uses `location.hostname`); the suffix is now
  stripped before the link is generated. Found during on-hardware
  validation (GL.iNet MT3000).

- **Portal install hardening: directory listings off, htdocs guard,
  anchored grep.** The portal uhttpd instance now sets `no_dirlists='1'`
  (the SPA ships no `index.html`, so `/` must not expose a file inventory
  to pre-auth clients); the stub installer removes an `htdocs` found as a
  regular file instead of failing silently; and the new port-2051
  idempotency guard greps for `port 2051$` so a hypothetical
  `port 20512` cannot false-positive.

- **Upgrade no longer rotates management-WiFi credentials.**
  `setup_private_network()` now reuses an existing private SSID/PSK
  from `wireless.private_radio0` and only generates fresh values when
  none is configured, so a version-bump-triggered setup rerun no longer
  drops every paired admin device from the management network.

- **Backend API firewall: port 2121 restricted to LAN interfaces.**
  New nftables include (`30-backend-firewall.nft`) blocks the backend
  API from non-br-lan interfaces. WiFi clients still reach the payment
  endpoint via NDS users_to_router rules. WAN-side and upstream clients
  can no longer directly probe the backend API. Defense-in-depth for
  #226 — does not change the listen address or payment flow.
- **Discovery logging: structured scan history for TollGate AP analysis.**
  Background scan cycles now log every discovered AP (BSSID, SSID, signal,
  radio, TollGate flag, price/step) to `/etc/tollgate/discovery_log.jsonl`
  (persistent across reboots; log-rotated). An in-memory registry tracks
  known TollGates across scans with signal range, sample count, and latest
  pricing. New CLI command `tollgate-cli upstream known` shows the summary.
  The `upstream scan` output now includes `is_tollgate`, `price_per_step`,
  and `step_size` fields — **placeholders until vendor-IE discovery lands
  (#332)**: nothing populates them yet, so `is_tollgate` logs as `false`
  and pricing as zero values. Foundation for Phase 2 speed probing and
  Phase 3 advertised pricing in #311.

### Fixed

- **CORS: local/same-host origin echo only — wildcard removed.**
  `CorsMiddleware` no longer falls back to `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`;
  the origin is echoed only for local/private origins and for pages served
  by the router itself on another port (e.g. the portal on uhttpd :2051
  calling the API on :2121), with `Vary: Origin` added on echo. The backend
  API is LAN-firewall-protected rather than credential-protected, so a
  wildcard would let any website read API responses from a browser on the
  TollGate network (OWASP). POSTs with content types other than
  text/plain or application/json now return 415 instead of 400.
  ([#349](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/349))

- **Spending condition validation: reject P2PK/HTLC-locked tokens.**
  `tollwallet.Receive()` now checks each proof's secret for spending
  conditions before crediting the user. Tokens with P2PK or HTLC locks
  are rejected with `ErrLockedToken`, preventing an attacker from
  getting free internet access with tokens the gateway can never spend.
  Found during cashu-audit Layer 3 audit. Fixes #324.

- **Fund() token decode: use generic DecodeToken instead of V4-only.**
  `merchant.Fund()` called `cashu.DecodeTokenV4()` (V4-only, no V3
  fallback). Changed to `cashu.DecodeToken()` which tries V4 then V3.
  Fixes #325.

- **Mint HTTP 429 error mapping.** When a Cashu mint returns 429
  (rate limit), the error code is now `mint-rate-limited` with a
  user-friendly message instead of generic
  `payment-processing-failed`. Gonuts v0.10.0 handles retry internally
  ([#260](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/issues/260)).

- **SSRF guard on post-payment NDS session trigger.** The new
  `triggerNdsSession()` (added for router-to-router usage tracking) now
  validates the upstream `GatewayIP` before issuing the port-80 HTTP GET,
  rejecting loopback, link-local, and unspecified addresses. Without this,
  a malicious or corrupt advertisement could coax the downstream into
  probing the local box. Also demotes the per-payment success log from
  `Info` to `Debug` (it fires on every renewal and was noisy)
  ([#88](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/issues/88),
  [#315](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/315)).

- **Lightning quote persistence: data race + crash-safety fix.**
  `persistLightningQuotes` now deep-copies `lightningQuoteRecord`
  values under the `RLock` instead of sharing pointers — eliminates a
  data race where `saveQuotes` read mutable fields
  (`SessionGranted`, `Allotment`, `CompletedAt`) from shared pointers
  after the lock was released. `saveQuotes` now calls `tmp.Sync()`
  before `tmp.Close()` so the rename-atomicity guarantee holds on
  power-loss. Adds 5 concurrency tests as regression guards.

- **Cashu wallet swap-counter race (critical).** Bump `gonuts-tollgate`
  from v0.7.1 to v0.7.4 to pick up the fix for an unrecoverable
  "blinded message already signed" error (NUT-02 code 10002). In v0.7.1
  the keyset counter was incremented only after a successful swap, so
  a transient mint failure (timeout, DNS hiccup, 5xx) left the counter
  stuck — every retry reused the same counter, the mint rejected with
  10002, and the wallet bricked permanently with no self-recovery.
  v0.7.4 increments the counter before the swap call and adds a
  `swapWithRetry` path that regenerates fresh blinded messages on
  retry.

- **Mint URL fuzzy matching in `calculateAllotment()`.** The mint URL
  from Cashu tokens was compared against configured accepted mints
  using exact string equality (`==`), causing payments to fail when
  the URL differed by a trailing slash, uppercase host, or path
  normalization. `calculateAllotment()` now uses the existing
  `tollwallet.MintURLMatches()` function which tolerates these
  differences — the same function already used by the wallet layer
  during `Receive()`
  ([#250](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/issues/250),
  [#251](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/issues/251)).

- **HTTP response body reads now limited to 1 MB.** All `io.ReadAll`
  calls on HTTP response bodies (LNURL resolve, invoice fetch, gateway
  probes, usage tracker) now use `io.LimitReader` with a 1 MB cap,
  matching the existing limit on the main payment handler. Prevents
  OOM crashes on resource-constrained routers when a malicious or
  compromised upstream service returns an oversized response
  ([#267](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/267)).

- **Lightning quote persistence across restarts.** Lightning invoice
  quotes are now persisted to disk (`quotes.json` in the wallet
  directory) so they survive process restarts. Previously all pending
  quotes were stored in-memory only; when `tollgate-wrt` restarted
  (deploy, config change, or crash), users who had already paid saw the
  portal stuck on "Waiting for payment" because the backend returned
  `lightning quote not found`. On startup, persisted quotes are loaded,
  expired/settled ones are pruned, and monitoring goroutines are
  relaunched for unpaid quotes so access is granted if the invoice was
  settled while the process was down
  ([#248](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/248)).

- **Protocol compliance: notice event codes and tips tag.** Map
  implementation-specific notice event codes to spec-defined codes from
  TIP-01 (`session-management-failed`, `gate-open-failed`, and
  `allotment-calculation-failed` → `session-error`;
  `payment-error-token-spent` already matched). Codes with no spec
  equivalent (`payment-error-invalid-token`, `invalid-mac-address`,
  `payment-processing-timeout`, `payment-processing-failed`) are kept
  as-is with precision in the content string. Also remove non-existent
  TIP-03 and TIP-04 from the advertisement `tips` tag — only TIP-01 and
  TIP-02 are defined.

- **Wireless config missing-file guard.** `scanner.GetRadios()` and
  `connector.getRadiosFromConfig()` now return gracefully when
  `/etc/config/wireless` does not exist instead of erroring every scan
  cycle
  ([#196](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/196)).
- **Dead firewall include removed.** The `firewall-tollgate` include file
  was silently rejected by fw4 (nftables); rules now created directly via
  UCI named sections with idempotent guards
  ([#196](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/196)).
- **Makefile references to deleted firewall-tollgate.** PR #196 removed
  `files/etc/config/firewall-tollgate` but two Makefile references (install
  rule + conffiles list) were left behind, breaking all package builds
  ([#235](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/235)).
- **Upstream gateway IP validation.** Loopback, unspecified, and
  link-local addresses are now rejected in the TollGate prober to prevent
  SSRF
  ([#196](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/196)).

### Changed / Internal

- **Cross-implementation hash_to_curve vectors.** `src/tollwallet` now pins
  NUT-00 `HashToCurve` output byte-for-byte against the canonical
  cross-implementation vector set (gonuts/btcec ↔ cashu-core-lite/k256 ↔
  coincurve/Python), including the hex-looking-secret trap. Y is what
  NUT-07 checkstate keys on — divergence silently reports spent proofs as
  unspent (the bug class found twice in prta #86 review).
  ([#351](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/351))

- **Safe exec wrapper package.** New `src/sysexec/` package providing a
  testable `Runner` interface with context, timeout, structured logging,
  and retry support for `exec.Command` calls. Foundation for refactoring
  the 37 existing exec.Command call sites (#263). 13 tests, stdlib only
  ([#265](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/265)).

- **Operator guide.** New `docs/operator-guide.md` covering every `tollgate`
  CLI subcommand (service, wallet, private network, upstream Wi-Fi, config,
  health) with example output, flags, and a troubleshooting section; README
  modules table and documentation list updated to reflect the full CLI
  surface
  ([#188](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/188)).

- **config_manager buildinfo tests synced to 7 production mints.** The
  `buildinfo_test.go` expectations were stale after #359 added five more
  production mints (lnserver.com, macadamia.cash, westernbtc.com, kashu.me,
  cubabitcoin.org) and made `IsDevBuild()` treat `unknown`/empty branches as
  non-dev. Tests now assert 7 production mints on `main`/`unknown`/empty and
  8 (7 + testnut) on feature branches, matching the merged behavior.

- **CI: `src/merchant` added to the go-test matrix.** The merchant module
  now builds and tests standalone (its go.mod gained the ltcsuite/ltcd
  `exclude` directive and a full re-tidy in #361), so it is no longer
  omitted from the matrix. `src/cli`, `src/upstream_detector` and
  `src/upstream_session_manager` remain omitted pending the same rewrite.

### Security

- **Exposed deployment backup purged from history.** A router
  deployment backup directory (`deploy-backup-20260730/`) containing
  the merchant private identity key, an ecash `wallet.db`, and
  spendable recovery tokens was accidentally committed in #358.
  `main` was rewritten on 2026-08-27 to remove the path from all
  commits and force-pushed; incident details and residual-exposure
  notes in `SECURITY.md`, key rotation tracked in
  [#364](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/issues/364).

## [v0.5.0] - 2026-07-03

Everything merged into `main` since `v0.4.0` (tagged 2026-04-06),
including the `v0.5.0-alpha1` through `v0.5.0-alpha3` pre-releases.
Release notes: [RELEASE-NOTES.md](RELEASE-NOTES.md).

### Added

- **Upstream WiFi management.** New manager that detects and connects to
  upstream gateways, with a startup connectivity check, TollGate-aware probing,
  and a cross-radio DHCP nudge to recover stuck links
  ([#109](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/109),
  [#122](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/122)).
- **Mint resilience.** Per-mint health tracking, try-all-mints fallback on
  payment, and automatic recovery of mints that come back online, so a single
  failing mint no longer blocks purchases
  ([#120](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/120)),
  plus aggressive mint health-check retry on startup so a router that boots
  faster than its uplink still finds its mints.
- **SSL/HTTPS management for the captive portal**, all new in this release and
  implemented in Go, with a self-signed certificate mode, hostname setup
  (`TollGate`), and captive-portal domain configuration
  ([#123](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/123)).
- **Lightning checkout and balance view** in the captive portal
  ([#107](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/107)).
- **Schema-driven configuration with a `--json` CLI.** `GetConfigSchema()` and
  dot-path get/set with validation, plus `tollgate --json config
  schema/get/set/save` (and health/wallet) commands to support admin-UI
  integration. Ships with a test workflow, schema contract lint, and a
  build-purity contract test
  ([#147](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/147)).
- **x86_64 / amd64 build target** for virtual-lab testing
  ([#80](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/80) and
  follow-ups).
- **Local OpenWrt SDK source-build helper** for reproducing package builds
  off-CI
  ([#105](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/105),
  [#79](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/79)).
- **Merchant degraded mode.** A zero-dependency `PaymentMerchant` interface
  ([#138](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/138)),
  mint health tracking with a provider and sentinel error plus USM decoupling
  ([#139](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/139)),
  and dynamic upgrade/downgrade between full and degraded operation
  ([#140](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/140)),
  surfaced through a captive-portal degraded-mode UI
  ([#141](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/141)).
- **SSL management rewritten in Go** with wrapper scripts, replacing the earlier
  shell-driven approach
  ([#142](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/142)).
- **V2 keyset ID support** for CDK 0.16.0+ compatibility
  ([#126](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/126)).

### Fixed

- **Transport reliability on OpenWrt:** force TLS 1.2 and set HTTP client
  timeouts so requests no longer hang on constrained routers
  ([#137](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/137)).
- **Security:** generate passwords with `crypto/rand` instead of time-based
  (`math/rand`) entropy
  ([#111](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/111)).
- **First-boot stability:** eliminate the reboot race, speed up `uci-defaults`,
  and unify the AP SSID
  ([#84](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/84)).
- **Install/postinst:** execute UCI defaults and reload services during
  `postinst` so a fresh install comes up correctly
  ([#90](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/90)).
- **Captive portal / HTTPS:** prevent the `uhttpd` crash loop by configuring a
  cert/key for HTTPS, keep NoDogSplash on port 80, and make the cert CN match
  the actual hostname
  ([#123](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/123)).
- **Firewall:** prevent duplicate NoDogSplash firewall rules in
  `users_to_router`
  ([#123](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/123)).
- **Packaging:** wrap the `.ipk` as a gzipped tar instead of an `ar` archive so
  it installs on stock OpenWrt
  ([#100](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/100)).
- **Payment correctness:** case-insensitive mint URL comparison, proper
  spent-token detection, valve re-auth without a stale in-memory cache, and
  trust `X-Forwarded-For` only from localhost, plus IP/MAC input validation and
  a 1 MB request-body cap
  ([#104](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/104)).
- **Merchant payout safety / valve timer race:** guard against `PricePerStep=0`
  division-by-zero, prevent a `uint64` underflow in payout, and stop a stale
  valve timer callback from deleting its replacement
  ([#161](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/161)).
- **Two-router autopay reliability:** retry `ndsctl auth` briefly in the valve
  so a payment's gate-open no longer fails on the first attempt when NoDogSplash
  has not yet registered the reseller client (previously failed with "failed to
  open gate" and recovered only via the token-recovery path ~60–90s later)
  ([#170](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/170)).
- **Wallet/mint registration:** register all accepted mints in the wallet at
  startup, and always open the gate for bytes (data-metered) sessions
  ([#167](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/167)).
- **Config migration:** fix the `config_version` `v0.0.7` → `v0.0.8` migration
  ([#174](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/issues/174))
  and the `upstream_detector` `go.mod`
  ([#172](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/issues/172))
  ([#178](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/178)).
- **BOLT11 / NoDogSplash:** make BOLT11 decode non-fatal and set the NoDogSplash
  gateway port to 2050
  ([#158](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/158)).
- **Captive-portal bypass:** disable IPv6 on the LAN during installation so
  clients cannot route around the portal
  ([#148](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/148),
  [#160](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/160)).
- **Session lifecycle:** evict expired timed sessions and start the scan loop
  ([#106](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/106)).
- **Additional security hardening and correctness guards**
  ([#163](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/163)).

### Changed / Internal

- **Default profit share:** split the 0.21 dev share across three maintainer
  identities (`c08r4d0r`, `amperstrand`, `origami74`, 0.07 each), each with its
  own Lightning address; applies to fresh default configs, existing configs are
  not rewritten
  ([#165](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/165)).
- **Release distribution:** publish redundantly to multiple relays and Blossom
  mirrors
  ([#152](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/152)),
  and list every successful Blossom mirror as a `url` tag on the NIP-94
  release events
  ([#183](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/183)).
- **CI:** split compile from package, add APK output and batched publish, native
  `.ipk` packaging with a flag-based matrix and a compression gate, and run the
  build workflow on pull requests
  ([#97](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/97),
  [#98](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/98),
  [#80](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/80)).
- Moved the `random-lan-ip` UCI default out to `tollgate-os`
  ([#96](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/96)).
- Renamed `c03rad0r` to `c08r4d0r` across the codebase
  ([#92](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/92)).
- Dead-code and docs cleanup sweep
  ([#81](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/81)).
- **CI:** replace artifact actions with Blossom + Nostr coordination
  ([#155](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/155))
  and expand the test matrix to cover standalone-buildable modules
  ([#157](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/157)).
- **CI:** skip the build/publish pipeline for fork PRs, which cannot access the
  publishing secrets
  ([#166](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/166)),
  and build an `x86_64` `.apk` variant
  ([#183](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/183)).
- **Tests:** make the root-module test hermetic via a fresh temp config dir
  (`testenv` build tag), so the suite runs off-router
  ([#169](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/issues/169),
  [#179](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/179)).
- Add `AGENTS.md` with LLM contributor rules and tighten `.gitignore` for
  planning docs
  ([#159](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/pull/159));
  since expanded alongside the new [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and
  [PR-REVIEW.md](PR-REVIEW.md).
