#
# The defect this guards (measured on the bench MT3000, 2026-09-26): the router
# had three names and no two of them agreed. THIS script re-minted a suffix on
# every full setup (RANDOM_SUFFIX, "${BRAND_HOSTNAME}-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"), the
# installer minted its own on every deploy while writing only the hostname and
# the captive SSID — it skips private_radio* on purpose — and the private SSID
# took a suffix from a THIRD path ("c08r4d0r-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"). Nothing was
# ever stored, so nothing could be reused: hostname=tollgate-OQ3Q, a captive
# SSID re-minted to tollgate-0GLK by a later deploy.
#
# The contract now, shared with the installer (OpenTollGate/tollgate-installer,
# branding_test.go — the same case table, because the two writers must agree;
# two exceptions are documented, not claimed away: the nym CHARSET, which is
# [A-Za-z0-9_-] here and weaker there, and the installer's suffix-less
# nodogsplash banner — docs/architecture/one-device-code.md):
#
#   store         /etc/config/tollgate, `config device 'device'`
#                 option code '<4 x [A-Z0-9]>'
