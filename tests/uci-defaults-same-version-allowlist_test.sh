# Offline tests for the captive-portal allow list on the SAME-VERSION setup
# path of packaging/files/etc/uci-defaults/99-tollgate-setup.
#
# The real bug this guards: the flag file /etc/tollgate-setup-done stores the
# setup version, and when it already equals SETUP_VERSION the script takes the
# short path — verify the wireless APs, re-assert the uhttpd contract, delete a
# stale nodogsplash gatewaydomainname — and returns. That path never touched
# the nodogsplash users_to_router allow list, so an install of a build whose
# version string is unchanged (the pre15 round: both pre14 and pre15 report
# v0.6.0-alpha3, so apk sees the same 0.6.0_alpha3-r0 and the flag stays equal)
# kept the pre-existing list. On that round the `allow tcp port 443` pre-auth
# rule introduced for the LuCI :8080 -> https:// redirect was missing and the
# router came out of the install with a 4/9 sweep: uhttpd.main.redirect_https=1
# answers :8080 with `307 Location: https://<router>/`, nodogsplash REJECTs
# :443 for an unauthenticated client, and LuCI is unreachable before payment.
#
# Nothing here needs a router, the SDK or the network: the setup script is
# copied into a temp dir (only its SETUP_FLAG and LOGFILE paths are rewritten —
# both are absolute paths into the live system) and run with `/bin/sh` against
# a fake `uci` and a fake `apk`, so the real driver — version resolution, the
# same-version branch, the allow-list writer — is exercised end to end.
#
# Second bug this guards: the same writer used to ADD `allow tcp port 8090` and
# `allow tcp port 8443` — the admin board's uhttpd instance on :8090 (plain
# HTTP) and its opt-in :8443 TLS listener. `users_to_router` is nodogsplash's
# PRE-AUTHENTICATION allow list, so an unauthenticated guest on the open SSID
# could load the board's login form and POST credential-carrying JSON-RPC to
# its /ubus endpoint over cleartext. The board is owner-facing (reached over
# br-private, exactly like the whitelabel configUI in setup_uhttpd_configui)
# and is not part of the customer journey, so the admin ports must be ABSENT
# from the list — and actively removed by every setup path, because an earlier
# install (or a build of either writer from before this change) put them there
# and a deployed router only converges if the removal is re-asserted.
