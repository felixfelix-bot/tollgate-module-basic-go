# run-keyset-rotation.sh — two-phase keyset-rotation e2e for the swap-fee path.
#
# Phase A boots mint-rotate with ONE active keyset at input_fee_ppk=100;
# the client mints proofs on it. Phase B recreates the container with that
# keyset EXPIRED (same mnemonic-derived ID) plus a fresh zero-fee active
# keyset; the client then pays with the phase-A proofs — cdk-mintd 0.17.6
# refuses swaps on expired keysets outright, and the test pins that this
# surfaces as a clean classified payment error.
#
# Usage (from tests/cloud-lab/):
#   ./run-keyset-rotation.sh          # full run, teardown at the end
#   KEEP=1 ./run-keyset-rotation.sh   # leave the lab up for inspection

# COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME isolates this run's project (see README "Per-checkout
# project isolation"). CLOUD_LAB_EXTRA_COMPOSE layers an override file on
# every invocation — e.g. one that strips the host port bindings when
# another service on the host already holds 8085/8087; the tests talk to
# the mints over the compose network's DNS, only the settle probe needs a
# reachable URL, which MINT_ROTATE_PROBE_URL then points at the network
# path (docker compose run --rm --entrypoint python3 client
# probe_mint_settlement.py http://mint-rotate:8085).
COMPOSE=(docker compose -f docker-compose.yml)

# on it, so the base file must be passed explicitly and the auto-loaded
# docker-compose.override.yml re-appended (#436's trap; renewal_e2e.sh
# carries the same fix) — otherwise EXTRA_COMPOSE alone builds "service
# reseller has neither an image nor a build context" and the isolation
# escape hatch silently disappears for override users.
