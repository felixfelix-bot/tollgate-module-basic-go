"""
test_two_router_autopay.py — P0.2a: Two-router autopay chain test.

Validates the reseller flow:
  1. Reseller TollGate discovers upstream TollGate
  2. Client pays reseller
  3. Reseller uses the payment to buy access from upstream
  4. Client gets internet access through the chain

This test requires the 'two-router' Docker profile:
  docker compose --profile two-router up -d

Without the profile the whole module skips (reseller not running) — a
default `docker compose run --rm client` must stay green instead of
failing two tests on connection-refused.

Note: In the Docker lab without real WiFi, the upstream discovery uses
the stub network monitor which fires a fake interface-up event. Full
router-to-router discovery requires QEMU + real OpenWrt. This test
validates the payment and session management logic only.
