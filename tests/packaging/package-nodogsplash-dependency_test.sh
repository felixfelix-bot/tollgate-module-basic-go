# Offline test for the captive-portal dependency contract of every in-tree
# packaging recipe — no router, no SDK, no network needed.
#
# The real bug this guards: the module's SDK package definition declared
# The bug: the SDK package definition declared `REPLACES:=nodogsplash
# base-files` while depending on libc alone, and the `.ipk` recipes stamped the
# equivalent `Replaces: nodogsplash` into the control file opkg reads. On the
# apk lane the installed artifact carried `depends:libc` and no `replaces`
# field (raw `apk mkpkg` invocation in the build log), so nothing pulled or
# retained the daemon and the portal was down after install until nodogsplash
# was reinstalled by hand; on the opkg lane `Replaces` supersedes the named
# package. Either way the module must declare the daemon it gates the network
# with and must never claim to replace it.
#
# The shipping-path feed definition never had the bug
# (`DEPENDS:=+nodogsplash +jq`, no REPLACES); this test pins the module's own
# recipes to that contract so the divergence cannot come back.
