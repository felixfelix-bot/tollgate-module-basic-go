# assert-portal-bundle-contract.sh - guard the captive-portal bundle the module
# ships inside the APK/IPK.
#
# The module does not compile the portal: packaging/portal-build.sh builds it
# from the revision pinned in packaging/build-inputs.json (.portal.commit) and
# stages the result into packaging/files/. Five failure modes are guarded here.
#
# CHECK A - pinned portal decodes Cashu tokens without a keyset list
#   The token-validation path must be keyset-agnostic (cashu-ts
#   getTokenMetadata / equivalent). A decode call that needs a MintKeyset list
#   - `getDecodedToken(token)` with no second argument - throws on every v4
#   (cashuB) token that carries a SHORT keyset id, which is what
#   coinos/minibits hand out:
#
#     getDecodedToken(v4Token)  -> "A short keyset ID v2 was encountered, but
#                                   got no keysets to map it to."
#     getTokenMetadata(v4Token) -> OK
#
#   reproduced against the pinned dependency (@cashu/cashu-ts 2.9.0) with the
#   coinos v4 fixture the portal itself uses in tests/unit/mint-fee.test.js.
#   The portal surfaces that failure to the user as #CU102, so a release pin
#   with this decode must not ship.
#
#   NOTE: the two strings above are cashu-ts internals. They are present in
#   bundles built from BOTH the regressed and the fixed portal revisions (the
#   bundler preserves the strings, not the identifiers), so grepping a built
#   bundle for them cannot be used as the gate - the pinned SOURCE is checked
#   instead. A minimum-diff marker for the fixed revision is that its bundle
#   also carries the getTokenMetadata call the fix introduces (verified: the
#   regressed bundle has 0, this one has 1) - reported below, not asserted.
#
# CHECK B - the committed bundle matches what the pin actually builds
#   The tracked part of packaging/files/tollgate-captive-portal-site/ (and
#   tollgate-admin/) is a checked-in copy of the pinned build output; the
#   hashed JS assets are gitignored and rebuilt from the pin. If a build has
#   been staged in this tree (run `bash packaging/portal-build.sh` first), the
#   staged bytes must come from the pinned commit and the tracked copy must
#   still match them, i.e. `git status` must be clean inside those two dirs.
#
# CHECK C - the pinned portal sends the client MAC on the Lightning calls and
#           defines the strings it renders (#LN004)
#   Two defects shipped together and are guarded together, because advancing
#   the pin to pick up one fix (check A) can silently drop the other:
#
#     C1 the /ln-invoice handler identifies the client by its "mac" query
#        parameter and only falls back to an IP-derived lookup when that is
#        empty, but the portal sent it on NEITHER the invoice CREATE (POST)
#        nor the status POLL (GET). An invoice created without the MAC was
#        billed against whatever address the request appeared to come from,
#        and the poll could not match it back to the device the operator is
#        on - the Lightning payment step of the happy path fails (#LN004).
#
#     C2 the portal renders `LN003_*` / `LN004_*` error strings but
#        public/locales/en.json defined neither, so the user saw the literal
#        i18n key instead of a message.
#
#   Both are asserted against the pinned SOURCE (and, when a build is staged
#   here, reported against the staged bundle): the minified bundle keeps
#   `mac=${encodeURIComponent(` and the defined keys verbatim.
#
# CHECK D - the pinned portal's swap-fee pre-check passes real keyset OBJECTS
#           (the CU110 "token too small" gate)
#   src/helpers/mint-fee.js pre-checks a submitted token against the mint's swap
#   fee, so a token the fee consumes entirely gets a clear message instead of the
#   mint's opaque "no outputs provided" error. getDecodedToken(token, keysets)
#   wants MintKeyset OBJECTS as its second argument: cashu-ts maps a v2 SHORT
#   keyset id by reading `id.slice(0, proof.id.length)` off each entry. Handing
#   it a list of id STRINGS therefore made that read `undefined.slice` and throw
#
#     TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'slice')
#
#   on every real v4 short-keyset note (coinos.io, minibits). The helper's catch
#   swallowed the throw into { status: 0 } = "no pre-check", so the CU110 "token
#   too small" gate silently never fired and the under-funded token was
#   submitted anyway. Advancing the pin for another fix can silently drop this
#   one again - check A passes on the broken revision too - so the decode shape
#   is asserted here:
#
#     D1 the regressed shape is GONE - no list of keyset id strings is handed to
#        getDecodedToken;
#     D2 the fixed shape is PRESENT - the keysets given to getDecodedToken are
#        built as objects, which is what cashu-ts reads;
#     D3 the decode cannot fail SILENTLY - the fixed helper logs why it gave up
#        (`could not decode token proofs`), which is the string that made the
#        CU110 regression diagnosable instead of invisible.
#
#   Asserted against the pinned SOURCE; the staged-bundle counts for the two
#   diagnostic strings the fix introduces are reported in the informational
#   block below.
#
# CHECK E - the pinned portal renews an expired session IN PAGE and selects the
#           mint the pasted note came from
#   Two customer-visible defects shipped together and are guarded together,
#   because one pin advance carries both and a later one can silently drop
#   either:
#
#     E1 the expired view was a dead end (#60). Its only action was
#        window.location.reload() ("Refresh Portal"), while the purchase UI
#        lives in the parent Cashu/Lightning component, which stays mounted in
#        its `success` state - so the customer's only route back to buying time
#        was to disconnect from and reconnect to the Wi-Fi (the copy told them
#        to). The fix wires the expired view to the payment method through an
#        onRenew prop (handleBuyMoreTime): clearing the expired state re-renders
#        the purchase flow with NO reload and NO navigation, and
#        window.location.reload() is gone from the renewal path.
#
#     E2 the purchase page ignored the mint the note advertises (#61). One
#        access option is advertised per mint and the allocation/price is
#        mint-dependent (price, step_size and min_steps all come from the
#        selected option), so a hand-picked mint showed the wrong price for the
#        note the customer pasted. src/helpers/cashu.js now derives it from the
#        note (normalizeMintUrl folds scheme/trailing slash/case/default port to
#        one identity, mintUrlFromToken decodes just enough of the note to learn
#        its mint and returns null for anything undecodable, findMintOption
#        picks the advertised option for it) and the locale defines the
#        unsupported_mint_notice it renders for an unaccepted mint.
#
#   Asserted against the pinned SOURCE (App.jsx, cashu.js, en.json); the
#   staged-bundle counts for the new i18n keys are reported in the informational
#   block below, where the old key's count shows whether the dead end is still
#   in the shipped bytes.
