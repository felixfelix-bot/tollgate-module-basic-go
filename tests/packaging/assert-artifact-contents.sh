#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Assert that a built tollgate-wrt package actually ships the runtime files
# that live in the source tree under packaging/files/.
#
# The packaging recipes have historically installed source files one by one,
# so adding a file to packaging/files/ did not add it to the package: the
# firewall ruleset shipped without etc/nftables.d/30-backend-firewall.nft and
# left the backend API on :2121 exposed on every non-br-lan interface. This
# script encodes the invariant so that drift fails the build instead of
# reaching a router: the packaged etc/nftables.d/ set must EQUAL the source
# set (no missing, no stray extra file) and each ruleset file must match its
# source byte-for-byte in size (an empty or truncated file is a failure, not
# a pass).
#
# A second invariant rides along on the same packaged artifact: the guest
# portal bundle the package ships must be the revision the #60 fix produced (an
# expired session renews IN PAGE instead of the "reconnect to the Wi-Fi" dead
# end). It is asserted on the PACKAGED BYTES — every
# etc/tollgate/tollgate-captive-portal-site/assets/*.js read out of the built
# .ipk/.apk — and never by re-deriving the bundle from
# packaging/build-inputs.json .portal.commit. A guard that reads the pin cannot
# see stale bytes, which is exactly how the dead end reached a router with every
# source-level guard green (PR felixfelix-bot/tollgate-module-basic-go#10: the
# pin was honest, the shipped tree was older, and only a browser caught it).
# The two i18n key literals survive minification and discriminate:
#
#   staged bundle              session_expired_buy_more   session_expired_reconnect
#   pinned (fixed) portal       1                          0
#   pre-#60 portal              0                          1
#
# so the invariant is: buy_more >= 1 AND reconnect == 0. A packaging row that
# ships no guest portal at all is reported and not evaluated — such a row cannot
# ship a stale bundle, and the runtime-set report below already names that
# divergence as its own defect.
#
# Usage: tests/packaging/assert-artifact-contents.sh <package-file>
#
#   .ipk  -> read the data tarball with tar
#   .apk  -> read the package manifest with apk (override with APK_BIN=...)
#
# Exit 0 when the invariant holds, 1 otherwise.
