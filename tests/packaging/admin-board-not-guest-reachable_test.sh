# Offline test for the invariant that the owner-facing admin board is not
# reachable from the captive/guest network. No router, no SDK, no network.
#
# The real defect this guards: uhttpd.admin serves the admin board on :8090
# over plain HTTP with `ubus_prefix=/ubus`, so the board's login form and
# rpcd's session endpoint share one cleartext origin, and the session that
# opens through it reaches ACL group `tollgate` — `file:["exec"]`,
# `system:["password_set"]`, `tollgate wallet_drain_cashu`, i.e. root command
# execution, a root password change, or the operator's money. The captive
# bridge that guests sit on is br-lan, and the board was reachable from it two
# ways at once: nodogsplash's pre-auth allow list carried `allow tcp port 8090`
# /`8443` (written by two different scripts), and nothing in the packet filter
# stood in front of the port for an *authenticated* guest either.
#
# The allow-list half is covered behaviourally by
# tests/uci-defaults-same-version-allowlist_test.sh and
# tests/uci-defaults-nodogsplash-443_test.sh, which run the shipped script
# against a fake `uci`. This test covers the other half — the packet-filter
# rule that does not depend on the allow list being in the intended state —
# and the packaging invariant that the rule actually ships (an nftables file
# under packaging/files/ that no recipe installs is not a control).
#
# It reuses the repo's existing packaging tier rather than inventing a harness:
# the recipe-coverage check follows
# tests/packaging/package-nodogsplash-dependency_test.sh (parse the recipe, not
# the comment describing it), and the artifact check builds a real package with
# packaging/build-ipk.sh and runs tests/packaging/assert-artifact-contents.sh
# against it, exactly as the build does.
#
# Usage: bash tests/packaging/admin-board-not-guest-reachable_test.sh
