# Offline tests for the SETUP-MARKER ORDERING of
# packaging/files/etc/uci-defaults/99-tollgate-setup.
#
# The bug this guards (observed on the bench MT3000, 2026-09-24, three times):
# `/etc/tollgate-setup-done` stores the setup version and the driver compared it
# with the shipped version for EQUALITY. A different version therefore counted
# as a NEW version, and a DOWNGRADE is a different version — so rolling alpha5
# back to alpha4 re-ran FULL setup, re-randomised the guest SSID and recreated
# the nodogsplash / :8090-guard state, silently clobbering operator-chosen state
# mid-test. The fix is an ORDER-aware comparison:
#
#   marker absent                  -> full setup        (first boot)
#   marker equal to shipped        -> verify/repair
#   marker OLDER than shipped      -> full setup        (a real upgrade)
#   marker NEWER than shipped      -> verify/repair ONLY (a roll-back)
#   marker not orderable           -> verify/repair + re-stamp the marker
#
# Three layers of test, so a revert of any one part is caught:
#
#   1. A case table over the comparison itself (`version_relation`,
#      `setup_marker_decision`), sourced from the real script in lib-only mode.
#   2. End-to-end runs of the real driver against a fake uci/apk/shadow, one per
#      case, asserting WHICH BRANCH ran (the log line the driver writes), that
#      the guest SSID and the operator's own choices survived every roll-back,
#      that the policy list was still re-asserted, and what the marker file
#      holds afterwards.
#   3. The FAILING NEGATIVE CONTROL: the same roll-back fixture run against a
#      copy of the same script whose decision call is replaced by the pre-change
#      equality predicate. That run must take the FULL-setup branch and
#      re-randomise the guest SSID — i.e. the test is proven to fail when the
#      comparison is equality-based.
#
# The end-to-end harness copies the shipped script into a temp dir and rewrites
# the absolute paths into the live system (flag file, log, /etc/profile,
# /proc/sys/kernel/hostname, /etc/config/nodogsplash) plus the two credential
# paths the script already exposes as SHADOW_FILE/PASSWD_FILE. Nothing else is
# touched: the driver under test — version resolution, the ordering decision,
# the verify/repair branch and the full-setup branch — is the shipped code, and
# the host's own hostname, /etc/profile and /etc/shadow are never written.
