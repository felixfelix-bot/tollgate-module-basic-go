"""Minimal Cashu token inspector used ONLY by the opt-in paid lane.

The harness must not spend the operator's ecash by accident, so before it will
POST anything that carries value it insists on knowing what it is about to
spend. That is what this file is for.

NUT-00 has two serialisations:
  * `cashuA...`  -- v3, base64url(JSON)   -> fully parseable here.
  * `cashuB...`  -- v4, base64url(CBOR)   -> CBOR text strings appear verbatim in
    the byte stream, so the mint URL is recoverable with a regex over the decoded
    bytes; integer amounts are NOT reliably recoverable without a CBOR decoder,
    so the caller must declare the amount it is willing to spend
    (RHP_SPEND_MAX_SATS) and this module reports that it could not verify it.

Nothing here talks to a mint. Nothing here redeems anything.

stdlib only.
