"""API-shape, captive-quote and (opt-in) paid-purchase checks against a live router.

Everything in the DEFAULT run is a read, except exactly one POST that carries an
empty body -- which cannot touch anyone's ecash, because there is no proof in it.
The only code path that can move value is the paid lane, and it is gated on
RHP_CASHU_TOKEN + RHP_SPEND_MAX_SATS (see paid_lane below). If you are reading
this because the harness spent something you did not expect, that gate failed and
that is a bug worth reporting.

# The SECOND purchase -- OPT-IN (RHP_SECOND_PURCHASE=1 + RHP_CASHU_TOKEN_2).
#
# WHY THIS LANE EXISTS: the step allotment is 21 MiB, so a customer spends the
# first one in minutes and buys again. That second purchase IS the club's happy
# path, and it is the one that failed on real hardware (2026-09-25, pre17 on an
# MT3000): the portal showed a NEW allotment, /balance agreed, and the client
# still had no internet -- and no OS captive-portal prompt either, so it was
# neither redirected nor served. The paid lane above only ever buys ONCE, so
# nothing in this suite could see it.
#
# The assertion that matters is the GATE, never the balance. /balance is the
# module's own memory of the session; on the failing box it said the allotment
# was restored while the customer's traffic was still dropped. So this lane ends
# with a request through the customer's OWN data path (RHP_EGRESS_PROBE_URL,
# default the Android probe URL) and requires an online answer -- 200/204, no
# redirect. The two failure shapes a shut gate produces are named in the FAIL
# detail instead of being collapsed into "no internet":
#   * a 3xx to :2050/splash.html?redir=...  -> still intercepted in NoDogSplash
#   * no answer at all                      -> not redirected and not served

# matches `iifname "br-lan"`: the gate exists for clients ON the captive bridge
# and nowhere else. A probe issued from the management vantage does not traverse
# that chain at all, so it answers 204 whether the gate is open or wide shut -- a
