# Offline test for the sharded release pipeline: the plan reader
# (scripts/ngit-shards.sh), the shard renderer (scripts/ngit-gen-shards.py) and
# the announce gate (scripts/ngit-release-announce.sh).
#
# The point of the gate is that it REFUSES: a release whose shards did not all
# succeed must not be announced. So most of this file is negative controls --
# a missing shard record, a missing leg record, and a leg record left over from
# a previous release run at the same commit must all end in "nothing published",
# and that is asserted by counting the publication calls, not by trusting the
# exit code alone.
#
# `nak` is replaced by a record/replay shim on PATH; no relay is contacted and
# no event is published anywhere.
#
# Usage: bash tests/ngit-release-pipeline_test.sh
