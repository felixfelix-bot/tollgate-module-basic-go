// The ndsctl invocation contract (t_83e6ab0f, measured on the bench MT3000,
// pre17, 2026-09-26).
//
// `ndsctl` is the module's only way to take access away, and the module runs it
// under a deadline it owns (`ndsctlTimeout`), so the module is one of the two
// things that can end a child. The other is the environment (procd on a service
// restart, the OOM killer, an operator).
//
// The measured log could not tell them apart: 97 lines of
//
//	Error deauthorizing MAC address   error="signal: killed"
//
// on a box whose nodogsplash control socket had stopped answering. `signal:
// killed` is what Go prints for a child that died on a signal, so an invocation
// THE MODULE ITSELF killed after its own deadline — and one killed by whatever
// else owns the box — were logged identically, and every state machine reading
// those lines drew its own conclusion. A restart adds a second case: the module
// has no shutdown path at all (`Stop` is never called), so in-flight children
// are killed with the process and their failures are reported as ndsctl
// failures.
//
// The contract these tests pin:
//
//  1. an ndsctl invocation the MODULE ended is reported as such, naming what
//     happened, instead of as a bare `signal: killed`;
//  2. `Stop` DRAINS in-flight children before it returns, so a service restart
//     does not kill an invocation that was about to answer;
//  3. an invocation interrupted because the module is stopping is reported as a
//     shutdown, never as an ndsctl failure — and the module does not start new
//     children while it is stopping.
//
// The tests drive the REAL runner (`runNdsctl`'s production implementation) with
// a fake `ndsctl` binary on PATH: that is the only way to exercise the deadline,
// the kill and the drain, which is what the defect is about.

// captureValveLogAtLevel redirects the package logger into a buffer, so a test
