// A client NoDogSplash has FORGOTTEN (the zombie-session contract).
//
// Measured on the bench MT3000 (pre17, module pin 2796d96c, 2026-09-26) with a
// real Wi-Fi client, a8:a0:92:a5:39:7a: the module held a session for an address
// NoDogSplash no longer knew at all. `ndsctl deauth <mac>` answered
//
//	Client a8:a0:92:a5:39:7a not found.
//
// and exited 1 — and the module read that exit status as an UNCONFIRMED CLOSE. It
// kept the gate tracked, retried it for ever (unconfirmed_closes 113 -> 193 ->
// 195, driving ndsctl at the sweep cadence) and logged "this client may still
// hold open, unmetered access", which is FALSE in this state: NoDogSplash does
// not know the MAC, so there is no access for it to hold. The retry storm is what
// wedged the ndsctl socket ("Socket is not ready for communication : Bad file
// descriptor" every ~5s) — and with a wedged socket a PAID purchase could not be
// granted either (state=PAID, merchant wallet +1 sat, access_granted never true).
// That is the operator's "second purchase showed a new allotment but no internet".
//
// The three failures this file pins, in order:
//
//	1. "client not found" is a COMPLETED close: retire, do not arm a retry;
//	2. the close retry is BOUNDED: neither the attempts nor unconfirmed_closes
//	   may keep growing once the budget is spent;
//	3. the wording must match the verified state — never "may still hold open,
//	   unmetered access" for a MAC ndsctl does not know.
//
// The budget and the wording assertions are deliberately phrased against the
// *behaviour* (how many deauth calls reach the enforcement layer, whether the
// counter moves, what the operator is told) rather than against a particular
// implementation of the bound.

// zombieNdsctl is a stubbed ndsctl seam whose deauth answers exactly what the
// real one answered on the bench. It counts the deauth calls per MAC, so a test
// can assert how hard the module drives the enforcement layer.
