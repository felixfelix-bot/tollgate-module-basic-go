// Startup reconciliation of NoDogSplash's authorisations against the module's
// sessions (t_83e6ab0f, deliverable 3; the inverse drift to the stale-binding
// reconciliation in stale_binding_janitor.go).
//
// The module's gate, session and baseline bookkeeping is PROCESS-LOCAL: nothing
// loads it at startup, so a module restart starts from an empty session set.
// NoDogSplash's client list does NOT die with the module — nodogsplash is a
// separate service and keeps every client it had authorised. The result is
// measured, not hypothesised (`~/tg-manual/restart-drift-ln-20260926T112454Z.log`,
// bench MT3000, pre17): buy, gate open, restart ONLY `tollgate-wrt`, and the
// client is still `state=Authenticated` in `ndsctl json` with
// `probe=204`/`egress 200` while the freshly restarted module holds no session
// at all. Nothing on the box meters that client until NoDogSplash's own session
// timeout clears it. That is free, unmetered internet.
//
// The resolution is fail-closed, and the reason it can be decided at all is an
// ordering invariant the purchase path already guarantees: grantSessionAccess
// records the session BEFORE it opens the gate (and restores the previous record
// if the open fails). So at any instant, a MAC NoDogSplash holds as
// Authenticated that appears in NEITHER the session map NOR the valve's tracked
// gates is not a purchase in flight — it is a record this module cannot meter
// and did not make. Its gate is closed.
//
// What that costs, stated plainly: the customer's remaining allotment is NOT
// carried across a module restart (it lived in the memory of the process that
// died), so a paying customer whose box restarted mid-session must buy again.
// The alternative — leaving the gate open — is unmetered internet with the
// module unable to say what was spent, which is the direction C1-2 forbids. The
// honest statement of the limit: entitlement cannot travel with a session until
// it travels with a session ticket (next-release work), and this pass does not
// pretend otherwise.

// ReconcileNdsAuthorisationsOnStartup closes the gate of every client NoDogSplash
// still authorises that this module holds no session for, and reports what it
// found. It is called once, synchronously, from StartDataUsageMonitoring, i.e.
// from merchant construction.
//
// At boot that construction happens before the merchant is installed behind the
// API and before apiStartup opens the gate, so the pass cannot race a purchase
// that is being served. It is NOT only a boot pass: the degraded -> full upgrade
// constructs a merchant at RUNTIME too (MerchantDegraded.AttemptUpgrade ->
// newFullMerchant -> StartDataUsageMonitoring, wired to the mint tracker's
// first-reachable callback), and on that path the API is already open. It is
// still safe there, for two reasons that do not depend on the boot ordering:
// the merchant being served at that moment is the DEGRADED one, which refuses
// every purchase (it has no wallet), so no grant can be in flight; and a client
// that was mid-session when the mint went away is still named by the valve's
// process-global tracked gates, which knowsClient treats as the module's own.
// Anything that removes either of those — a merchant that is serving while it is
// reconstructed, or a downgrade that forgets the tracked gates — turns this pass
// into one that closes a paying client's gate, so both are load-bearing.
//
// It is deliberately NOT run periodically. The drift it repairs is created by
// exactly one event — this module starting (its session set starts empty while
// NoDogSplash's list survives) — so a startup pass is the whole of the repair;
// the drift in the other direction (a session the module holds whose client
// NoDogSplash has forgotten, or whose device has left the network) is the
// stale-binding reconciliation's, and that one does run periodically because a
// device can leave at any time.
//
// Not covered, and stated as such: a boot that finds no reachable mint starts the
// module in degraded mode (merchant.New returns MerchantDegraded), whose
// StartDataUsageMonitoring is a no-op, so this pass does not run until a mint
// becomes reachable and the upgrade constructs a full merchant. A box that
// restarts with no uplink therefore keeps NoDogSplash's authorisations until the
// upgrade — the window this pass exists to close is closed at the upgrade, not at
// the boot.
