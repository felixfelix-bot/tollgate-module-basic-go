// The unmeterable-session escalation's CADENCE (t_83e6ab0f item 2, measured on
// the bench MT3000, pre17, 2026-09-26):
//
//	10:21:09 ERROR: the usage of the bytes session of 02:11:22:33:44:55 has been
//	        unreadable for 39 sweeps ...: the session cannot be metered, so its
//	        gate is closed rather than left open unmetered
//
// A session whose counters the module cannot read is closed after a minute of
// grace, and that is the right fail-safe direction: an unmeasurable session left
// open is unmetered internet. But the sweep runs every 2 s, so once the grace
// window was over the module repeated the escalation — and the close failure
// under it — on EVERY sweep, for as long as NoDogSplash refused the close. That
// is the same unbounded, self-inflicted log storm the close-retry budget was
// added for, one layer up: 60 identical ERROR lines a minute, which is how a
// real escalation stops being readable.
//
// The contract: the force-close is escalated ONCE, and while the session stays
// unmeterable the module reports at most once per
// unmeterableSessionReportInterval, at WARNING. What must NOT change: the
// session stays TRACKED (a failed close is not a close) and the module keeps
// attempting the close, so the state still converges when ndsctl recovers.
