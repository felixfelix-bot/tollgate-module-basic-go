# .ngit — Nostr CI (ngit-ci)

ngit-ci reads workflows from `.ngit/act/workflows/` **only** — files under
`.github/workflows/` are detected but never executed. GitHub Actions is
untouched; the two systems run side by side.

## What runs, and why

| File | Checks |
| --- | --- |
| `act/workflows/test.yml` | The port of `.github/workflows/test.yml`: per-module Go tests over the module matrix, the main-package `testenv` test, `js-schema-lint`, the `Spec-quote drift check`, `build-purity`, and the dependency/import-path checks. |
| `act/workflows/go-test.yml` | The pre-PR sequence documented in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md), run from `src/`: `gofmt -l .`, `go vet ./...`, `go build ./...`, `go test -race -count=1 -tags testenv ./...`. |
| `act/workflows/repro-check.yml` | The fast lane of `.github/workflows/repro-check.yml`: rebuild both Go binaries in two independent clean roots (separate HOME, module and build caches) and require byte-identical SHA-256s. The package targets (`portal`, `ipk`, `ipk-upx`, `apk`) stay on the GitHub workflow's `workflow_dispatch` slow lane and on a build host (they need `docker`), and are covered here by `build-package*.yml` below. |
| `act/workflows/build-package-binaries.yml` | Stage 1 of the release pipeline: cross-compile the five GOARCH/GOARM/GOMIPS targets, build the captive-portal assets, mirror both to Blossom, and publish the build-id records stage 2 consumes. |
| `act/workflows/build-package-<shard>.yml` | Stage 2, **sharded**: one workflow file per group of legs, rendered from [`packaging/ngit-release-matrix.json`](../packaging/ngit-release-matrix.json) by [`scripts/ngit-gen-shards.py`](../scripts/ngit-gen-shards.py). Eleven shards cover the same 14 `.ipk` + 3 `.apk` matrix the single file used to. Each builds its legs, mirrors them to Blossom, and publishes one kind-30078 record per leg — **no** kind-1063. See "Sharded stage 2" below. |
| `act/workflows/build-package-announce.yml` | The only file that publishes kind-1063. It runs [`scripts/ngit-release-announce.sh`](../scripts/ngit-release-announce.sh), which refuses unless every shard of this (version, channel, release run) reported success and every leg in the plan has a build record naming that same release run; then it announces, then it runs the publication gate over the whole matrix. |
| `act/workflows/verify-publication.yml` | The publication gate on its own: for every `(arch, format)` the release matrix declares, a kind-1063 announcement must exist for the verified version+channel, and the artifact must be fetchable from >= 2 Blossom mirrors with the sha256 carried in its `x` tag. Started by a `verify/<version>/<channel>[/<scope>]` ref, which names the published version to audit. Expectations are the **union** of the shard files. |

Two Go files because they cover different things: `test.yml` tests the nested
modules (which `./...` from `src/` does not reach — they are separate modules)
and the `tests/contract` checks, while `go-test.yml` runs the documented gate
that `test.yml` omits (`gofmt`, `go vet`, `go build`, and a race-enabled run of
the root module).

### `test.yml` was NOT a faithful copy until 2026-09-12

The first port claimed to be "a faithful, verbatim port" but **silently dropped
the `Spec-quote drift check` step** that `.github/workflows/test.yml` runs (the
two files agreed everywhere else, so a diff was the only way to see it). The
step is restored, so the two files are now byte-identical in content. Verify
with:

```bash
diff -u .github/workflows/test.yml .ngit/act/workflows/test.yml   # empty
```

Local evidence for the restored step (run in a worktree at `1a3cbb4`):

```
pip install --user "git+https://github.com/rustyrussell/greatspectations.git@0f22649"
git init nuts && git -C nuts fetch --depth=1 origin 49a909ce && checkout FETCH_HEAD
greatspectate check --config specquotes.toml \
  --comment-start "// " --comment-continue "//" <56 non-test src/**/*.go>
-> exit 0 (56 files, no drift)
```

## Triggers

`test.yml` and `go-test.yml` run on **push to `main`** and on **pull requests**.
Stage 1 (`build-package-binaries.yml`) does too, with the GitHub twin's
`paths-ignore` (`**.md`, `docs/**`), plus `v*` tags.

The eleven stage-2 shard files and the announce file declare **`workflow_dispatch`
only**, on purpose: a push to `main` must not fan out into twelve `act`
invocations on a host whose `NGIT_CI_MAX_CONCURRENT_JOBS` is 1. They are started
by manual replay — normally by [`scripts/ngit-ci-release.sh`](../scripts/ngit-ci-release.sh),
which is also what enforces the order.

**Sequencing, and why it is not automatic.** A push to `main` (or a `v*` tag)
enqueues stage 1, and `resolve-inputs` in each shard polls for the stage-1
records for only 10 minutes while stage 1 takes 11.8 min warm / 20.8 min cold.
The pipeline is therefore driven, not fired:

1. stage 1 runs on the push — or is replayed by hand, 11.8–20.8 min;
2. its workflow result (kind 9842) must read `success`;
3. every shard is then replayed in turn, and only after **all** of them are
   `success` is `build-package-announce.yml` replayed.
   `scripts/ngit-ci-release.sh <version> <channel> <commit>` does exactly this,
   stops the chain at the first non-success, and resumes with `--release-run`
   so a retry does not restart the whole matrix.

The two release stages hand over through the build id (the commit's short SHA)
and two addressable kind-30078 records stage 1 publishes, exactly as before:

```
d=tollgate-build/<build_id>/binaries   {"arm64":"<sha256>", "armv7":"…", …}
d=tollgate-build/<build_id>/portal     {"sha256":"…","filename":"portal-assets.tar.gz","urls":[…]}
```

What changed with the sharding is only *who* publishes the artefacts and *when*:
each shard publishes one kind-30078 record per leg, and the announcements moved
to a file that can see all of them.

What ngit-ci does **not** honour, and what the port does about it:

| GitHub feature | ngit-ci | Port decision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `schedule:` | not supported | not used |
| `workflow_dispatch` | replay only; `inputs` are never delivered | the twin's `full_compression` boolean is replaced by a ref test (see below), and the shard/announce jobs take their version, channel and release run from the **ref** they are replayed at |
| `concurrency:` | not honoured | documented; the build id is the commit, so coordination records are addressable and a re-run replaces rather than duplicates |
| `needs:` **across files** | impossible — one file is one `act` invocation | replaced by the ordered driver plus a relay-side gate: a shard never waits for another shard, but nothing is announced until all of them report |
| dynamic `strategy.matrix` from `needs.<job>.outputs` | **not supported** ("matrix values built from expressions do not [work]") | the matrices are written out as static YAML — one file per shard, all rendered from `packaging/ngit-release-matrix.json` |
| `matrix.*` in a **job-level** `if:` | rejected: `Failed to match job-factory: Unknown Variable Access matrix`, which invalidates the whole file | the variant rule is dropped (all variants always build) and `if:` at job level is used only as `always()` |
| `container:` / `services:` | **refused** with `startup_failure` when the operator sets container options (this deployment does) | the SDK jobs run `docker run openwrt/sdk:<target>@sha256:<digest>` from a plain job (see below) |
| `actions/upload-artifact` / `download-artifact` | **fails**: `Unable to get the ACTIONS_RUNTIME_TOKEN env variable` | nothing crosses a job boundary in an artifact, and nothing crosses a *file* boundary either; the portal assets travel over Blossom, like the compiled binaries already did |
| `github.token` / `GITHUB_TOKEN` | empty | nothing depends on it |
| `peter-evans/repository-dispatch@v4` | impossible | replaced by the `os-handoff` job (a kind-30078 Nostr record) plus a printed manual instruction |
| secrets | only to maintainer-authored triggers | `secrets.NSEC_HEX` is provisioned operator-side (see below) |
| 30-minute budget | the whole `act` invocation is bounded by `--job-timeout-secs` (1800 s) | see "Sharded stage 2" |

The GitHub twin dropped the UPX compression variants on a non-release ref by
filtering the matrix it generated with `jq`. Neither half of that is available
here: a dynamic matrix is unsupported, and a job-level `if:` that reads
`matrix.*` makes act's schema validator reject the *entire file* —

```
Failed to match job-factory: Unknown Variable Access matrix
Actions YAML Schema Validation Error detected
```

— so the ngit port builds **every** variant on **every** run: 14 `.ipk` entries
and 3 `.apk` entries. That is *more* coverage than the twin, not less, which is
the shape the operator asked for ("build the matrix so we can publish as many
architectures as we like"). The cost is eight extra jobs on a side-branch or PR
run where the twin built only the base variants; on `main` and on `v*` tags the
two are identical. A job-level `if:` is therefore only used with `always()`, and
the one bit of ref-dependent logic (the tollgate-os handoff) is a `bash` check
inside the step.

## What the port changes, and why — measured, not assumed

Everything below was measured on this deployment (coordinator `765cd47b…` on
DQ05, `embedded-act` runner, `ghcr.io/catthehacker/ubuntu:act-latest`) with
`ci-probe.yml` runs on 2026-09-12.

* **Container daemon is usable from a job.** `NGIT_CI_ACT_CONTAINER_DAEMON_SOCKET`
  is set to `unix:///var/run/docker.sock`, so a job gets
  `/var/run/docker.sock` (mode `srw-rw---- root:2375`) and `docker version`,
  `docker pull` and `docker run --rm --user root` all work. That is what makes
  the SDK jobs possible: the twin's `container: openwrt/sdk:…` block is refused,
  but the image itself is not.
  The dind daemon is a *sibling*, so the job's filesystem is not visible to it:
  the package tree is streamed in with `docker exec -i … tar xzf -` and the
  built `.apk` is streamed out with `docker cp`.
* **Runner ceiling: 4 vCPU, 4 GiB.** `nproc=4`, `cgroup memory.max=4294967296`
  (4 GiB), `cgroup cpu.max=200000 100000` (2 CPUs of quota), host has ~5 GiB
  free. Job containers are capped at `--memory=4g --cpus=2` by
  `NGIT_CI_ACT_CONTAINER_OPTIONS`, and `NGIT_CI_MAX_CONCURRENT_JOBS=2`.
* **`go` is not preinstalled**, `nak` and `upx` are not either; `node`/`npm`,
  `python3`/`pip3`, `jq`, `curl`, `ar`, `tar`, `docker`, `make`, `apt-get` and
  `sudo` are. The port installs Go with `actions/setup-go@v6` pinned to the
  literal `1.25.0` (`go-version-file` is what failed first in this image) and
  installs nak from the pinned `v0.16.2` release.
* **No git metadata in the checkout.** `git rev-parse` inside a job reports
  *not a git repository* and `git rev-list --count HEAD` fails, so the twin's
  `git rev-parse --short HEAD` / `git rev-list --count HEAD` are replaced by
  `GITHUB_SHA`. A branch build is `<branch>.<height>.<sha>`, where the height
  falls back to `0` when history is unavailable; tagged releases are unaffected
  because their version is the tag name. `GOFLAGS=-buildvcs=false` for the same
  reason.
* **Blossom reachability from the runner.** `blossom.primal.net`,
  `blossom.psbt.me`, `blossom2.orangesync.tech` and `drive.cashu.email` answer;
  `blossom1.orangesync.tech` times out (25 s). The server list is left as the
  GitHub twin has it, with `BLOSSOM_MIN_SUCCESS=1`, but every upload pays a
  ~60 s penalty on the dead mirror. Dropping it from `BLOSSOM_SERVERS` at the
  top of the file is a one-line change if that cost matters.
* **`actions/cache@v4` is used**, marked `continue-on-error: true`, so a
  coordinator with caching disabled still runs the job. `setup-go` is called
  with `cache: false` for the same reason (a cache failure inside the action is
  not survivable).
* **Per-leg publishing of the coordination record.** Each package job publishes
  its own kind-30078 record keyed by `d=tollgate-build/<build_id>/<arch>/<fmt>/<compression>`,
  and each shard publishes a completion record keyed by
  `d=tollgate-build/<release_run>/shard/<shard_id>`. Both are written only after
  that leg's Blossom upload succeeded, so their presence is a statement about a
  real artifact. `build-package-announce.yml` is what turns them into kind-1063
  NIP-94 events — see "Nothing is announced until the whole release exists".
* **The 30078 records are kept**, not deleted. The GitHub twin published a
  NIP-09 deletion for them at the end of the run; here they are the ngit-native
  rendezvous point — a second workflow file, or a downstream consumer such as
  tollgate-os, can resolve them by build id.

## Sharded stage 2

Stage 2 is no longer one workflow file. The matrix and the shard assignment live
in [`packaging/ngit-release-matrix.json`](../packaging/ngit-release-matrix.json),
and [`scripts/ngit-gen-shards.py`](../scripts/ngit-gen-shards.py) renders one
workflow file per shard from it. The rendered files are committed (act needs
static YAML) and `scripts/ngit-gen-shards.py --check` fails when they drift from
the plan; the `release-guard` job runs that check before anything is announced.

The plan ships **eleven** shards covering the same 14 `.ipk` + 3 `.apk` legs the
single file used to:

| shard | legs | budget |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ipk-none` | the 6 `compression: none` `.ipk` legs | 600 s |
| `ipk-upx-fast-best` | `mips_24kc` `.ipk` at `upx-fast` and `upx-best` | 420 s |
| `ipk-upx-brute-mips-24kc` | `mips_24kc` `.ipk` at `upx-brute` | 1200 s |
| `ipk-upx-ultrabrute-{aarch64-cortex-a53,aarch64-cortex-a72,arm-cortex-a7,mipsel-24kc,mips-24kc}` | one `upx-ultra-brute` `.ipk` each | 1500 s each |
| `apk-mediatek-filogic` | `aarch64_cortex-a53` `.apk` (`none`) | 1500 s |
| `apk-mediatek-filogic-ultrabrute` | `aarch64_cortex-a53` `.apk` (`upx-ultra-brute`) | 1500 s |
| `apk-x86-64` | `x86_64` `.apk` (`none`) | 1500 s |

Grain is set by measurement, not taste. `upx --ultra-brute` costs 515 s for the
aarch64 pair on a 2-CPU cap (pinned upx 5.2.1; `--fast` 1.5 s, `--best` 67 s,
`--brute` 401 s; mipsel ultra-brute 418 s), so one ultra-brute leg per shard
fits a budget with room and five do not. The `.apk`/SDK legs get a whole
invocation each because on the unsharded run their containers were created and
then never got a slot — that is the difference between "the .apk path is
unproven" and "the .apk path cannot run".

Why shard instead of raising the ceiling (`NGIT_CI_JOB_TIMEOUT_SECS` is an
operator-side setting and could be raised): the same leg cost ~29 minutes
inside the unsharded run and 515 s in isolation. It was starved, not slow —
fourteen package containers sharing a four-vCPU host through a 2-CPU-per-job
cap. Raising the ceiling would have kept that contention and just spent more of
it. Sharding bounds the work per invocation; it does not weaken a check.

### Nothing is announced until the whole release exists

The reason to change *when* announcements happen is the failure the first
unsharded run actually produced: five of seventeen kind-1063 events existed,
the other twelve legs never ran, and nothing said so. A consumer could not tell
that release from a complete one.

Now:

* a shard publishes **no** kind-1063. It publishes one kind-30078 record per leg
  (sha256, mirror URLs, release run) and one shard-completion record;
* `build-package-announce.yml` publishes the kind-1063 events, and it runs
  [`scripts/ngit-release-announce.sh`](../scripts/ngit-release-announce.sh),
  which refuses unless **both** hold:
  1. every shard in the plan has a completion record for this release run with
     `status: "success"` and the leg count the plan declares, and
  2. every leg in the plan has a build record whose `release_run` is **this**
     release run.
* a refusal exits 1 having published nothing, and names the shard or leg that
  is missing.

The second condition is what makes the first one mean anything. kind-30078 is
addressed by its `d` tag, so a record from an earlier release at the same commit
is still there to be found; "the record exists" is only evidence about this
release if it names this release. That is also why the release run is minted per
release (`<build_id>-<UTC timestamp>`) and a release run equal to the build id
is refused outright — a previous success at the same commit must not be able to
stand in for this one.

The version, channel and release run all come from the **ref** the shard is
replayed at, because ngit-ci never delivers `workflow_dispatch` inputs:

```
refs/heads/release/<version>/<channel>/<release_run>/<shard_id>
refs/heads/release/<version>/<channel>/<release_run>/announce
```

so no shard can invent a version of its own, and every shard of one release
agrees on what it is building.

`scripts/ngit-ci-release.sh` drives it: push every release ref first (a manual
trigger names a commit the coordinator resolves from the mirror, so a trigger
for a ref that does not exist yet is accepted and then does nothing), trigger
each shard in order, wait for its kind-9842, **stop the chain on the first
non-success**, and start the announce last. The driver is convenience, not the
guarantee — the announce re-derives everything from the relays, so a driver bug
cannot publish a partial release.

### Why one file did not fit — the measurements that led here

The budget is per `act` invocation (one workflow file), not per job
(`--job-timeout-secs`, default 1800). With `NGIT_CI_MAX_CONCURRENT_JOBS=2`, two
files can run at once, and inside a file act parallelises jobs up to the host's
capacity — 4 vCPU and ~5 GiB free, against a 4 GiB / 2 CPU cap *per job*, means
roughly one to two package jobs are actually resident at a time.

Measured on this deployment: a job that installs nak, uploads to Blossom,
fetches the blob back and publishes + reads back a kind-30078 event takes
**13.6 s** wall (`ci-probe.yml`, commit `8e79b43`). The `.ipk` jobs are that
plus a ~10–40 MB binary download, an optional `apt-get install upx-ucl`, and the
`ar`/`tar` packaging — call it 40–90 s each. Fourteen of them, mostly serialised,
is 10–20 minutes: it fits, but with little headroom once the Go cross-compile
(`compile-binaries`) and the portal build are included.

The `.apk` jobs are the real risk: each must pull an OpenWrt SDK image, run
`make defconfig` over the SDK, and compile `nodogsplash`, `luci` and `jq` as
dependencies. That is very unlikely to finish inside 30 minutes from a cold SDK
image, and there is no way to raise the ceiling from inside the workflow — the
timeout belongs to the coordinator operator.

**The split is implemented — two files, two budgets.** The first manual
replay of the single-file pipeline (commit `1312f03`) was rejected by act's
schema validator in 675 ms; after that was fixed, the replay at `63eb38f` was
still inside `compile-binaries` eleven minutes in, with the Go module cache at
243 MB and the five Blossom uploads still retrying. A 17-job package stage
behind a 10–20 minute compile stage cannot fit one 30-minute budget, so the
pipeline is split by stage:

1. `build-package-binaries.yml` — `determine-versioning`, `compile-binaries`,
   `build-portal`. Its own 30 minutes.
2. `build-package.yml` — `resolve-inputs`, `package-ipk` (14), `package-apk`
   (3), `publish-metadata`, `os-handoff`. Its own 30 minutes.

They are tied together by the build id (the commit's short SHA) and by two
addressable kind-30078 records that stage 1 publishes:

```
d=tollgate-build/<build_id>/binaries   {"arm64":"<sha256>", "armv7":"…", …}
d=tollgate-build/<build_id>/portal     {"sha256":"…","filename":"portal-assets.tar.gz","urls":[…]}
```

`resolve-inputs` polls the coordination relays for those records for up to 10
minutes, so the two stages can be started back to back at the **same commit**
— and on a push to `main` both files are triggered by the same push anyway.
This is the ngit-native replacement for the twin's `needs.<job>.outputs`
(ngit-ci has no cross-file `needs`) and for `actions/upload-artifact` (broken
here). A stage 2 run against a commit whose stage 1 never ran fails loudly in
`resolve-inputs` with that explanation.

Each package job also publishes its **own** kind-1063 announcement, immediately
after its Blossom upload, instead of one `publish-metadata` job announcing
everything at the end. `publish-metadata` now verifies the announcements
against the build records, republishes any that are missing, and prints the
summary. The reason is the 30-minute ceiling: a run that is cut off mid-matrix
must still have announced everything it did build.

If three SDK architectures still do not fit one budget once their wall time is
measured, the same file is copied once per architecture
(`build-package-apk-mediatek-filogic.yml`, `build-package-apk-x86-64.yml`) —
they are independent runs that share the build id.

### What the first full stage-2 run actually measured

Measured on 2026-09-12, commit `b25d8a28`, manual trigger `342cb7de…`, workflow
result `b555a2057913fdb934af2b1facb3fc0000c2b58ac4248273d83ca596cfb6772c`,
`conclusion="timed_out"` at exactly the 1800 s ceiling:

* `resolve-inputs` resolved both stage-1 records in seconds, so the two-file
  hand-over works and the run got all the way to publishing artifacts.
* 4 of the 5 `compression: none` `.ipk` legs announced within 7 minutes
  (19:43:19, 19:43:59, 19:45:17, 19:47:04).
* One UPX leg announced at 20:10:14 — about 29 minutes into its own job.
  `upx --ultra-brute` on the 11.5 MB `tollgate-wrt` binary, applied to **both**
  binaries, is minutes of pure CPU, and `NGIT_CI_ACT_CONTAINER_OPTIONS` caps a
  job at 2 CPUs.
* The other 8 UPX legs did not finish, and the 3 `.apk` legs never executed a
  single step: their containers were created, but a 4-vCPU host saturating at
  ~2–4 concurrent jobs never freed a slot from the 14 `.ipk` legs. **The
  `.apk`/SDK path is still unproven on ngit** — say so plainly rather than
  implying it works.

So the full 14 + 3 matrix does **not** fit one 30-minute `act` invocation as
written. The ceiling is the coordinator operator's (`--job-timeout-secs`), so no
change inside the workflow can raise it. Options, in order of preference:

1. **Raise the coordinator's `--job-timeout-secs`** (one operator-side setting).
   Cheapest and needs no workflow change, but the measured stage-1 wall time is
   11.8 min warm / 20.8 min cold, so the compile stage is already close to the
   ceiling and a package stage wants 45–60 min for the whole matrix.
2. **Split by compression family**, one budget per known cost:
   `build-package.yml` keeps `resolve-inputs` + the 5 `compression: none` legs +
   `publish-metadata` + `os-handoff` (measured: 4 announced inside ~7 min), and
   a new file carries the 9 UPX legs, at most one arch family per file.
3. **Give the SDK legs their own files**
   (`build-package-apk-mediatek-filogic.yml`, `build-package-apk-x86-64.yml`)
   with the SDK image from a cache rather than cold: pulling
   `openwrt/sdk:<target>-25.12.0` and compiling `nodogsplash` + `luci` + `jq`
   will not fit 30 minutes even with the whole box.

Coverage is not reduced by any of these: the 14 + 3 matrix stays exactly as it
is. The follow-up is *coordination* — more, smaller files — not fewer
architectures.

## Verified end to end on ngit (2026-09-12)

Everything below is a real run against the ngit mirror at commit
`b25d8a28f179d470ae7443bcd113c8471d5685dc` (build id `b25d8a28`). Nothing was
simulated, and none of it came from a GitHub run — GitHub Actions is disabled
for this repository.

| stage | workflow | how it started | workflow result (kind 9842) | conclusion | wall |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `build-package-binaries.yml` | push to this ref | `460e9dc6d4ea12759e96889e776dfda6cf5e397560468f973351ba7f910b3a7c` | `success` | 706.7 s |
| 2 | `build-package.yml` | manual `9840 342cb7de9d0969d70480b3846f95c42d9aff9ebd353d09f1ef72598572017e8e` | `b555a2057913fdb934af2b1facb3fc0000c2b58ac4248273d83ca596cfb6772c` | `timed_out` (ceiling) | 1800 s |

Stage 1's hand-over records (kind 30078, signed by the CI release key):

```
d=tollgate-build/b25d8a28/binaries 65f30f854e8a416a29618cb976550420b67ecd44d74e8ee6bb655971a2519f33

```

Stage 2 resolved both, built `.ipk` packages, uploaded each to two Blossom
mirrors and published its own kind-1063 announcement **from inside the package
job** — five of them before the ceiling cut the matrix short:

Checked from the consumer side — against the *published events*, not the run
log:

```bash
$ curl -sSLo /tmp/dl.ipk \
    https://blossom.primal.net/fe20ef119f279de5ff59458a218eff03e209c194e8d2510e303b3bfd396c8721.ipk

# the same blob answers 200 on blossom2.orangesync.tech, so both url tags are live
# .ipk shape: ./debian-binary, ./data.tar.gz, ./control.tar.gz
# control:  Package: tollgate-wrt / Version: ci-ngit-build-package.0.b25d8a28

```

The UPX variant of the same arch fetches as 5,405,700 bytes against 7,373,435
for `compression: none`, with a 3,453,288-byte `tollgate-wrt` payload carrying
the `UPX!` marker — the compression legs really do compress.

Honest limits of this evidence:

* the stage-2 conclusion is `timed_out`, not `success` (see the split above):
  5 of the 14 `.ipk` legs announced, and the 3 `.apk`/SDK legs never started;
* the ref is a branch, so the announcements are `c=dev` with version
  `ci-ngit-build-package.0.b25d8a28` — that is what a non-tag ref produces by
  design; a `main` or `v*` run takes the tag/`main` version path;
* nothing was installed on a router from these packages, and the
  `tollgate-os` hand-off is a record plus a manual step, not a dispatch;
* the only change to the release workflow since `b25d8a28` is a comment block
  recording the two-stage sequencing above (the `TRIGGERS`/`SEQUENCING` note at
  the top of the file); the steps that were exercised are unchanged. The
  temporary `ci-probe.yml` diagnostic used to measure this deployment (runner
  ceiling, daemon socket, Blossom reachability) has been deleted now that the
  release path is verified — it also published a trial kind-30078 record under
  the release `d=tollgate-build/<build>/<arch>/ipk/<compression>` namespace,
  which is exactly why it should not be a standing workflow. The three events
  it had published (one kind 1063 and two kind-30078 records for the
  `x86_64 .../ipk/none` slot) are retracted with the kind-5 event
  `3384cfd4533c0e4aad105237f546a448b9957df81e77223402ef6b0a46929192`, signed by
  the CI release key.

## Release signing: the historical key is unrecoverable

Every stage-2 shard, and `build-package-announce.yml`, signs its Blossom uploads
and (for the announce file) the kind-1063 announcements with `secrets.NSEC_HEX`, which on GitHub was the release key
`5075e61f0b048148b60105c1dd72bbeae1957336ae5824087e52efa374f8416a`.

That key **cannot be recovered from GitHub**: Actions secret values are
write-only over every API, so not even an org admin can read one back. It is
also not present on this host or on DQ05 (every `nsec1…` token in the profile
stores, key directories and git configs was resolved to a pubkey and compared
against it — no match). Its only surviving copy is wherever the human who set
the secret kept it.

Until that key is supplied out of band, this port signs with a **new, dedicated
CI release key** provisioned by the operator:

```
pubkey 6cfc53c04bda7d58dd4dd0471d66f6a4ea7d3e123e78006e0e0c1abc1208ac0d
```

It is deliberately **not** the repository maintainer key (`36bdeb…`), which also
signs this repository's kind-30617 announcement and must not be handed to
workflow-executed code. Announcements made by the new key are attributable and
separable; a consumer filtering releases by the historical publisher pubkey will
not see them, which is why publishing a real alpha/beta/stable release is
blocked on the operator either importing the old key or blessing the new one.

**Status 2026-09-12: provisioned and verified.** The secret is in
`~/ngit-ci-deploy/.env` as `NGIT_CI_SECRET_TMBG__NSEC_HEX`, referenced from the
coordinator service's `environment:` block, and the coordinator logs
`Loaded per-repo secrets count=1`. It is not stored anywhere in this repository.
Verified without ever printing the value: the stored 64-character secret
resolves to exactly the pubkey above (`nak key public`, run on DQ05), and it is
the key that signed the two kind-30078 hand-over records and all five kind-1063
announcements in the verification section above. The historical publisher key
`5075e61f…` is still unrecoverable — a consumer that filters releases by
*that* pubkey sees none of these, which is why publishing a real
alpha/beta/stable release is still blocked on the operator either importing the
old key or blessing the new one as the release publisher.

### Provisioning it (operator, on DQ05)

Already done on this deployment; kept here because it is what a rebuilt
coordinator needs. Three things are needed, and the first one is easy to miss:

```bash
# 1. give the watched entry an alias, so per-repo secrets can be addressed.
#    A bare-pubkey entry with #ALIAS keeps exactly the same watch coverage.
#    .env ->  NGIT_CI_REPOS=npub1x677…#TMBG,<other entry>
# 2. declare the secret.  .env ->  NGIT_CI_SECRET_TMBG__NSEC_HEX=<64 hex chars>
# 3. PASS IT INTO THE CONTAINER.  docker-compose interpolates .env but only
#    injects the variables named under a service's `environment:` block, so
#    without this line the secret is silently absent:
#      NGIT_CI_SECRET_TMBG__NSEC_HEX: "${NGIT_CI_SECRET_TMBG__NSEC_HEX:-}"
cd ~/ngit-ci-deploy && docker compose up -d coordinator
```

Verify — the coordinator must log `Loaded per-repo secrets count=1`, and a
maintainer-authored push run must report a 64-character key (never print the
value):

```bash
docker logs --since 60s ngit-ci-deploy-coordinator-1 | grep -i "per-repo secrets"
```

Secrets are released only to runs whose *trigger event* was authored by a
confirmed maintainer, so a third-party PR gets an empty `NSEC_HEX` and the
upload step fails there by design. The secret never appears in git, in an
argument list or in a published event.

## Pushing to the ngit mirror

`git remote -v` in a normal clone shows only GitHub HTTPS remotes, and the
obvious approaches do not work. Verified 2026-09-12:

* the remote must be a `nostr://` URL —
  `nostr://npub1nng5mxk…/relay.ngit.dev/tollgate-module-basic-go` (the mirror
  npub follows the maintainer identity; it moved from `npub1x677…` with the
  2026-09-13 rotation). Pushing the `https://relay.ngit.dev/…` grasp URL fails
  with `send-pack: protocol error: bad band #69`; the grasp serves fetch only.
* `git-remote-nostr` resolves its signer with libgit2 from the repository's own
  config file, so `git -c nostr.nsec=…` and `extensions.worktreeConfig` are both
  invisible to it; a linked worktree silently falls back to the machine-global
  key (`npub1xtzgnzz…`), which is not a maintainer and is rejected with
  `your nostr account … isn't listed as a maintainer of the repo`. Push from a
  plain clone whose own `.git/config` carries the maintainer `nostr.nsec`.
* the exit status is untrustworthy in both directions, so confirm success with
  `git ls-remote https://relay.ngit.dev/<npub>/tollgate-module-basic-go.git refs/heads/<branch>`.
* the push also mirrors to `gitnostr.com` under co-maintainer
  `npub1xh6njjx…`; that transport fails with
  `ERR authorisation failed: No state events in purgatory`. It is the fallback
  copy, not the push: the ref lands on `relay.ngit.dev`.

A helper that does all of this (and refuses to run with the wrong key) is at
`/home/c03rad0r/push-ngit-tmbg.sh` on CobradorWave.

### Known relay gap

The coordinator log shows `Relay did not accept published event relay=wss://gitnostr.com`,
so CI results land only on `relay.ngit.dev`. Reading results therefore means
querying that relay explicitly, which is why the commands below name it.

## Reading results

- `ngit ci status <commit|pr>` — job and workflow state for a commit or PR.
  (The installed CLI is v2.6.1, which has no `ci` and no `status` subcommand;
  gitworkshop.dev shows the same results against the commit, and `nak` reads
  them directly.)
- Published kinds: **39842** workflow progress, **9841** job result (carries the
  job's log tail), **9842** workflow result/conclusion. Each names the commit,
  the workflow path and the SHA-256 of the workflow file's content.

```bash
COORD_HEX=765cd47badcbbc4a38c7d0c57d5607663b484c20cd59773f9f7064487f9431e8
nak req -k 9842 -a "$COORD_HEX" -l 5  wss://relay.ngit.dev   # conclusions
nak req -k 9841 -a "$COORD_HEX" -l 20 wss://relay.ngit.dev   # per-job + log tail
```

Only the **tail** of a job log survives in the 9841 `content`, which is why the
port's reporting steps print their summary last.

## Authorization

**This deployment runs the `request-required` policy.** Ordinary push and PR
runs do not start until a maintainer publishes a standing **Service Request
(kind 9843)** naming the coordinator and this repository. One is already
outstanding for this repo (observed in the coordinator log as
`Recorded Service control event … action="Request"`), so push triggers fire.
Manual triggers (kind 9840) are one-shot and bypass the gate; a 9840 that pins
`w` = `.ngit/act/workflows/<file>` and its content SHA-256 replays any file
regardless of its `on:` clause.

## Starting a run by hand

`scripts/ngit-ci-trigger.sh` publishes the kind-9840 Manual Trigger for this
repository, signed by the maintainer key. It is the replacement for the GitHub
twin's `peter-evans/repository-dispatch@v4` step (which dispatched into
`tollgate-os` with a cross-repo token that does not exist here), and it is how
anything in the release pipeline is started on a ref its own `on:` clause does
not cover:

```bash
scripts/ngit-ci-trigger.sh \
  .ngit/act/workflows/build-package-ipk-none.yml \
  "$(git rev-parse HEAD)" refs/heads/release/<version>/<channel>/<release_run>/ipk-none
```

For a whole release you do not call it directly — `scripts/ngit-ci-release.sh`
does, in the right order, and waits for each result:

```bash
scripts/ngit-ci-release.sh v0.6.0-alpha3 alpha "$(git rev-parse <commit>)"
#  --shards a,b,c      run a subset (validation, or a targeted retry)
#  --release-run ID    resume the SAME release run after fixing one shard
#  --then-announce     run only the announce (after the shards all succeeded)
#  --dry-run           print the plan and the refs, trigger nothing
```

The driver pushes every release ref to the mirror before it triggers anything,
because a trigger names a commit the coordinator resolves from the mirror: a
trigger for a ref that is not there yet is accepted, publishes its 9840, and
then does nothing at all. It also refuses an unknown shard id and a release run
equal to the build id, rather than silently running nothing.

`ngit-ci-trigger.sh` computes the `w` tag's SHA-256 from the file's content at
the declared commit (the coordinator rejects a mismatch), refuses to sign with
anything that is not the maintainer key, and never prints the key. The signing
key file defaults to `~/.hermes/.ngit-new-key` and is overridable with
`KEYFILE=`. **The maintainer identity rotated on 2026-09-13** to `9cd14d9a…`
(the key in that file), and `MAINT_HEX` follows it — the value is also the
identity in the `a=30617:<hex>:<repo>` coordinate, so a stale one names a
coordinate the coordinator does not serve. If a trigger starts failing, check
the live announcement first:

```bash
nak req -k 30617 -d tollgate-module-basic-go wss://relay.ngit.dev
```

`tests/ngit-ci-trigger_test.sh` exercises every refusal plus the hash
computation on a throwaway repo and an unreachable relay — no real event is
published:

```bash
bash tests/ngit-ci-trigger_test.sh     # 9 passed, 0 failed
```

## State of the checks right now

`cd src && gofmt -l .` prints nothing on the ngit mirror's `main` (commit
`cd67f81` formatted the three files — `config_manager/config_schema.go`,
`merchant/lightning_state_test.go`, `merchant/quotes_wireformat_test.go` —
that were failing it on GitHub `main`), so the first step of `go-test.yml` is
green here. `go vet ./...`, `go build ./...` and
`go test -race -count=1 -tags testenv ./...` pass locally with the pinned
`go1.25`. On GitHub `main` before `cd67f81` the `gofmt` step is red; the fix
is that same `gofmt -w .`.

## Publication verification — the gate, and how to audit a release

A release published from ngit must not be able to look successful while
consumers see nothing. PR #406 added exactly that gate — and it added it only
under `.github/workflows/`, which ngit-ci never executes, so the check shipped
in the repository and ran **nowhere**. This is the `.ngit` twin of it, and the
check is identical in meaning:

* for every `(arch, format)` the release matrix declares, a **kind-1063 NIP-94
  announcement** must exist on the channel relays for the published
  `v=<version>` + `c=<channel>`;
* the artifact must be fetchable from **at least two Blossom mirrors**, and the
  downloaded bytes must hash to the `x` tag of the event;
* a failure names the `(arch, format)` pair, or the mirror that failed, and
  exits non-zero — so the workflow result is not `success`.

### Where it runs

| entry point | expectations | how it starts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| the `verify-publication` job in `act/workflows/build-package-announce.yml` | the union of every shard file's static matrix — the 8 distinct `(arch, format)` pairs, over **all** compressions | at the end of the release: `needs: [release-guard, announce]`, so it runs only after the release has been announced |
| `act/workflows/verify-publication.yml` | the same union, with an optional format scope taken from the ref | push of a `verify/<version>/<channel>[/<scope>]` ref |

The second file exists so "did this version reach the channel?" is answerable at
any time, without re-running a release — and because a gate that shares a budget
with the thing it is auditing is a gate that can be cut off before it runs.

### Expectations come from the matrix, never from the relays

ngit-ci cannot build a `strategy.matrix` from job outputs, so the release matrix
is written out as static YAML — and a hand-kept second copy of it inside the
workflow's env would drift silently, which is the exact failure the gate exists
to catch. Both entry points therefore extract the pairs from the shard workflow
files with `scripts/ngit-matrix-expectations.sh`, which takes **several** files
and unions their rows (one shard's file would verify a subset), and exits 2
rather than printing an empty list: a parse failure can never become a
vacuously green run.

`scripts/ngit-shards.sh expectations` answers the same question from the plan
JSON, and the announce workflow uses it. The two must agree — a test asserts
they do, so a shard matrix that drifts from the plan is caught by the same suite
that catches a lost leg.

### Auditing a published version

ngit-ci never delivers `workflow_dispatch` inputs, so **the ref is the
parameter**:

```bash
git push ngit HEAD:refs/heads/verify/<version>/<channel>/ipk    # ipk | apk | all
git push ngit --delete refs/heads/verify/<version>/<channel>/ipk
```

The scope is printed by the gate, and every expectation it excludes is listed as
**NOT verified** — a narrowed pass must never read like a full one. The `.apk`
family is why the scope exists: on the unsharded run (2026-09-12) the three SDK
legs never started inside the 1800 s ceiling, so an `ipk`-scoped audit of an
ngit-era version could pass while the full gate would not. Since the sharding,
the `.apk` legs get their own invocations — see the run table below.

### Negative controls

A gate whose failure mode is a vacuous pass has to be tested by making it
refuse, so:

```bash
# a version that was never published must be refused
VERIFY_EXPECT="$(scripts/ngit-matrix-expectations.sh .ngit/act/workflows/build-package-*.yml)" \
  scripts/verify_publication.sh v0.9.9-does-not-exist alpha -
# -> FAIL: zero events match v=v0.9.9-does-not-exist c=alpha ; exit 1

# the same refusal as a red CI run
git push ngit HEAD:refs/heads/verify/v0.9.9-does-not-exist/alpha
```

The **announce** gate has its own negative controls, because its failure mode is
worse than a vacuous pass — it would publish a release that is not complete:

```bash
# a release run whose shards have not all succeeded is refused, and publishes nothing
scripts/ngit-release-announce.sh <version> <channel> <release_run> <build_id> --dry-run
# -> FAIL: shard '<shard>' published no completion record ... ; exit 1

# a build record left over from an EARLIER release run at the same commit is not evidence
# -> FAIL: leg <arch>/<fmt>/<comp> records release_run=<other>, not <release_run>
```

`tests/ngit-release-pipeline_test.sh` covers all of them offline against a
replay shim, and asserts that the publication call count is **zero** for every
refused release. `tests/verify_publication_test.sh` covers the publication gate
on the same ground.

`tests/verify_publication_test.sh` covers the same ground offline — `nak` and
`curl` are replaced by record/replay shims — including a missing `(arch,
format)` pair, a mirror shortfall, a sha256 mismatch against the `x` tag, an
announcement signed by an unrelated key, scope narrowing, and the fail-closed
expectation parser.

### Which key announced it

The gate accepts **both** release publishers — the historical GitHub Actions key
`5075e61f…` and the ngit CI key `6cfc53c0…` — because only one of them can still
sign anything (see "Release signing" below). It prints the announcing
publisher(s), and says explicitly when an announcement did **not** come from the
historical key: a consumer filtering `-a 5075e61f…` alone sees nothing published
after 2026-08-27, which is why `AGENTS.md` documents both keys.

## Not run here (deliberately)

- **Router-visible behaviour.** Nothing exercises a real router — captive
  portal, firewall, Wi-Fi, `ndsctl`.
- **`trigger-build-os`.** The GitHub twin dispatched into
  `OpenTollGate/tollgate-os` with a cross-repo token. There is no token and no
  Actions there, so the `os-handoff` job in `build-package-announce.yml` publishes a
  kind-30078 record (`d=tollgate-build-os-handoff/<build_id>`) and prints the
  `override_tollgate_wrt_version` value; **starting the build-os workflow is a
  manual step**.
- **act-image caveat.** ngit-ci runs jobs in `catthehacker/ubuntu:act-*` images,
  which are lighter than GitHub runner VMs. A red run there is an environment
  gap until the job's log tail says otherwise.
