"""Render the ngit release shards from packaging/ngit-release-matrix.json.

WHY A GENERATOR
  ngit-ci runs ONE workflow file per `act` invocation, and that invocation is
  bounded by the coordinator's NGIT_CI_JOB_TIMEOUT_SECS (1800 s here). The full
  14 .ipk + 3 .apk matrix does not fit, and neither does a per-arch grouping of
  it -- a single `upx --ultra-brute` leg has been measured at ~29 minutes on the
  2-CPU job cap, which is most of a budget on its own. Stage 2 is therefore
  sharded into one file per group of legs whose measured cost leaves headroom.

  Those files are ~95% identical (the same resolve-inputs, the same Blossom
  upload, the same per-leg kind-30078 record) and differ only in their static
  matrix. Hand-maintaining eleven copies of that is how a matrix silently loses
  a leg, so the matrix and the shard assignment live in ONE JSON file and these
  files are rendered from it.

  The rendered files ARE committed: act requires static YAML, and a reviewer
  should be able to read the workflow that runs without running a generator.
  `--check` fails when the committed copies drift from the plan, and the
  `release-guard` job runs `--check` before anything is announced, so a stale
  shard cannot reach a release unnoticed.

  Substitution is deliberately `@@TOKEN@@`-based rather than str.format(): the
  bodies are full of `${{ ... }}` workflow expressions and `${...}` shell
  expansions, and a format string would make every one of those a syntax
  hazard.

Usage:
  scripts/ngit-gen-shards.py [--plan PATH] [--outdir DIR] [--check] [--list]

Exit codes:
  0  wrote/validated every shard
  1  --check found drift (or a missing/extra shard file)
  2  the plan or the invocation is unusable

# This is shard `@@SHARD_ID@@` of the ngit release pipeline's stage 2. Stage 1 is

#
# WHY SHARDS EXIST
#   ngit-ci bounds ONE `act` invocation -- one workflow file -- with the
#   coordinator's NGIT_CI_JOB_TIMEOUT_SECS (@@CEILING@@ s on this deployment).
#   The full 14 .ipk + 3 .apk matrix does not fit that budget: the 5
#   `compression: none` .ipk legs are cheap, `upx --ultra-brute` is minutes of
#   single-threaded CPU per leg on a 2-CPU job cap, and on the first unsharded
#   run (2026-09-12, commit b25d8a28) the 3 .apk/SDK legs never got a slot at
#   all before the ceiling cut the run off. Coverage is not reduced by sharding
#   -- the 14 + 3 matrix is the same, only split across invocations. Never trim
#   a leg to make a shard fit.
#
# WHAT THIS SHARD DOES, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT
#   It builds its legs, mirrors each artifact to Blossom, and publishes one
#   kind-30078 record per leg carrying the sha256, the mirror URLs and the
#   release run id. It does NOT publish a kind-1063 announcement: announcements
#   are published by .ngit/act/workflows/build-package-announce.yml, and only
#   once EVERY shard of the same (version, channel, release run) has reported
#   success. A shard that fails or times out therefore leaves the release
#   incomplete and unannounced, instead of announcing a partial matrix that
#   looks finished. See scripts/ngit-release-guard.sh.
#
# HOW IT STARTS
#   Manual replay only (`workflow_dispatch`), so a push to main does not fan out
#   into one act invocation per shard. Start it with scripts/ngit-ci-release.sh,
#   which triggers every shard in order, waits for each kind-9842 result, stops
#   the chain on the first non-success, and only then starts the announce file.
#   The ref it is replayed at carries the version, the channel and the release
#   run:
#
#     refs/heads/release/<version>/<channel>/<release_run>/@@SHARD_ID@@
#
#   which is why every shard of one release publishes the same version and
#   channel even though it is a separate invocation.

          #     `apk mkpkg` invocation in the build log -- so nothing pulled or retained
          #     the daemon. After installing on a GL-MT3000 (OpenWrt 25.12.5) nodogsplash
          #     was gone and the captive portal was down until it was reinstalled by
          #     hand. Same failure class packaging/preinst already documents: an
          #     undeclared runtime dependency that a maintainer script needs, ending in
          #     the daemon being orphan-removed.
          #   - opkg lane (.ipk): the recipes additionally stamped `Replaces: nodogsplash`
          #     into the control file, where `Replaces` does supersede the named package.
          #
          # So: declare the daemon, never also claim to replace it. Same contract as the
          # shipping-path feed definition, net/tollgate-wrt/Makefile
