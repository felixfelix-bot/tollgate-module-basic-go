# Enforce the single source of truth for the release version.

# VERSION, at the repository root, is the one place the release version is
# written down. Everything else derives from it:
#
#   * CI (.github/workflows/build-package.yml) refuses to build a tag that
#     disagrees with VERSION, passes VERSION's value to -ldflags through the
#     go_ldflags helper in packaging/build-env.sh (the same helper
#     scripts/repro-test.sh calls), and version-stamps the .ipk control file
#     and the OpenWrt SDK Makefile with the tag / branch-derived
#     package_version;
#   * scripts/build-sdk-package.sh takes PACKAGE_VERSION from its caller (CI
#     passes the tag) and otherwise derives it from VERSION;
#   * the .ipk payload staging and the SDK Makefile substitute the
#     __TOLLGATE_VERSION__ placeholder that packaging/files/etc/uci-defaults/
#     99-tollgate-setup carries;
#   * packaging/local-build-ipk.sh falls back to reading VERSION itself.
#
# This script refuses to let a hand-written version literal creep back in,
# refuses a workflow Go pin that disagrees with packaging/build-inputs.json
# (the toolchain single source of truth), and optionally checks the tag
# against VERSION. Usage:
#
#   scripts/check-version-sync.sh            # internal consistency
#   scripts/check-version-sync.sh v0.6.0-alpha2   # ... and tag == VERSION
#
# It is wired into hooks/pre-commit and is a precondition in
# docs/release-process.md.
