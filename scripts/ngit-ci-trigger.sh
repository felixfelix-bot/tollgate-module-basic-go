# Publish a ngit-ci Manual Trigger (kind 9840) for this repository's Nostr
# mirror, signed by the repository maintainer.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#   GitHub Actions is disabled org-wide, so `.github/workflows/` never runs and
#   there is no `workflow_dispatch` button for the release pipeline. The
#   ngit-ci coordinator starts a normal push-triggered workflow by itself, but
#   the second stage of the release pipeline (`.ngit/act/workflows/build-package.yml`)
#   is only declared for `main` and `v*`, so on any other ref it has to be
#   started by hand. That is this script: the hand-runnable publish path.
#
#   It is also the documented replacement for the GitHub twin's
#   `peter-evans/repository-dispatch` step, which dispatched into
#   OpenTollGate/tollgate-os with a cross-repo token that no longer exists.
#
# NIP-C1 shape (ngit-ci NIP.md, "Manual Trigger"):
#   kind 9840, empty content, exactly one `p` tag naming the coordinator,
#   `a` the repository announcement, `c` the commit to run, `w` the workflow
#   path plus the SHA-256 of that file's content, optional `r` for the ref.
#
# nak quirk: a multi-value tag is written with ';' as the separator, not a
# space (verified 2026-09-12) -- so the `w` tag is "<path>;<sha256>".
#
# Usage: scripts/ngit-ci-trigger.sh <workflow-path> <commit> [ref]
#
# Environment overrides (used by tests/ngit-ci-trigger_test.sh):
#   WT         repository root (default: the git root of this script)
#   KEYFILE    file containing the maintainer nsec (default below)
#   COORD_HEX  coordinator pubkey to name in the `p` tag
#   MAINT_HEX  maintainer pubkey the signing key must resolve to. This is also
#              the identity in the `a=30617:<hex>:<repo>` coordinate, so it has
#              to track the repository's CURRENT announcement.
#
# THE MAINTAINER KEY ROTATED (2026-09-13): it is now
#   9cd14d9acdbab7ca162b772c91fa514da8e3248f61f924bf3441e6e72c5f0dee
# (npub1nng5mxkdh2mu593twukfr7j3fk5wxfy0v8ujf0e5g8nwwtzlphhqksqpew, the key in
# ~/.hermes/.ngit-new-key). The previous 36bdeb23… signature is superseded and
# the identity above signs the live kind-30617. A stale MAINT_HEX fails closed —
# it refuses to sign — but it also names the wrong repo coordinate, so a trigger
# would be dispatched for a coordinate the coordinator no longer serves. Check
# the live announcement when this fires:
#   nak req -k 30617 -d tollgate-module-basic-go wss://relay.ngit.dev
#   RELAYS     relays to publish to
#
# The signing key is never printed, echoed or passed on a command line that
# this script logs; it is read from KEYFILE and handed to `nak` via --sec.
