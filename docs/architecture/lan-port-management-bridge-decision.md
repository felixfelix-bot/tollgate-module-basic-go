## Context

### What the operator measured (2026-09-26, GL-MT3000 bench, pre18)

The operator administers the router from a laptop on an **Ethernet cable into a
LAN port**. That port is a member of `br-lan`, which is also the bridge the open
guest SSID is on, so the two admin-port guards drop the administration surfaces
for him exactly as they do for a stranger on the Wi-Fi:

- `packaging/files/etc/nftables.d/31-admin-board-not-guest-reachable.nft:52-53`
  drops `tcp dport { 8090, 8443 }` on `iifname "br-lan"`, both families;
- `packaging/files/etc/nftables.d/32-luci-not-guest-reachable.nft:54-55` drops
  `tcp dport { 8080, 443 }` on `br-lan`, both families.

His words: "neither luci on 8080 nor the luci alternative config ui on port 8090
are reachable". His requirement: a `br-mgmt` "where the connected devices can
access luci and the luci alternative dashboard, but they still need to pay".

The report is a bench report from that pre18 run, not a tracked issue; the two
guards that produce the lockout were introduced by #566
(`31-admin-board-not-guest-reachable.nft`) and #588
(`32-luci-not-guest-reachable.nft`), and this record is the first place the two
are considered from the wired port's side.

The guards are behaving exactly as designed. Both are written for the captive
bridge by name, and both say in their own headers that the management path is
`br-private` (the private SSID) and loopback — not the wired port
(`31-*.nft:38-42`, `32-*.nft:32-40`). The module's comment on the admin board
tells an operator in this situation to "use the module CLI or LuCI on `:8080`"
(`31-*.nft:41-42`), which is the lockout he reported.

### Why the ask is right: the wired port should not share the guest's L2 domain

The wired port and the open guest SSID are one bridge, deliberately gated as
one. The cost of that sharing was already measured in this repo:
`packaging/files/etc/uci-defaults/99-tollgate-setup:974-993` records that bridge
port isolation **cannot** separate a wired host from a guest BSS — netifd's
`isolate` is bilateral (`br_private.h br_skb_isolated`) and was measured on the
bench to block nothing — and names the alternative mechanism in as many words:
"a dedicated br-guest with its own reject-by-default zone, or a bridge-family
nft rule keyed on the VAP ports". A bridge of its own for the wired ports is
therefore not only the operator's preference, it is the fix for an exposure this
repo could not otherwise close: an operator's administration laptop currently
shares a broadcast domain with strangers, ARP, mDNS and all.

### The three layers that assume exactly one captive gateway

The request needs **two bridges with different pre-auth reachability, both
still gated**. Every layer of the shipped stack assumes one gated interface.

**1. The daemon (nodogsplash 5.0.2, the version this stack runs —
`packaging/Makefile:59` declares `DEPENDS:=+nodogsplash +jq`, and every bench
note in this repo names 5.0.2).** A nodogsplash process manages **one** interface:
`config.gw_interface` is a single `char *` (`src/conf.h:146`), parsed from a
single value (`src/conf.c:760`) and required non-null (`src/conf.c:1388`). Its
firewall chains have **fixed names** in one network namespace
(`src/fw_iptables.h:35-44`: `ndsNET`, `ndsRTR`, `ndsAUT`, `ndsTRU`, `ndsOUT`,
`ndsBLK`, …), they are created with `-N` in **both** tables (`mangle` at
`src/fw_iptables.c:442-446`, `filter` at `:534-538`), the jumps into them are
interface-scoped (`:449-452`, `-i <gw_interface> -s <gw_iprange>`) but the chain
objects are not, and teardown **flushes and deletes them by name** —
`iptables_fw_destroy()` at `src/fw_iptables.c:689-747` is a `-F`/`-X` sweep of
every `nds*` chain in `mangle`, `nat` and `filter` that no second process's
lifetime is consulted about. Its own doc comment says as much (`:685-686`:
"used when we do a clean shutdown of nodogsplash, **and when it starts**"), and
`src/main.c:297-305` is that start path — destroy runs *before* `init`, and a
failed init destroys again and `exit(1)`s. A second instance therefore wipes the
first's enforcement **on its own boot path**, not only when someone restarts
one; and under `procd_set_param respawn` (`net/nodogsplash`
`files/etc/init.d/nodogsplash:191`) a failing instance re-enters that path — a
loop, not a one-off wipe.

**2. The OpenWrt packaging genuinely does support N instances** — and that is
the trap, because it looks like the answer and is not. In
`openwrt/packages` `net/nodogsplash`, the init script iterates the config file
(`config_foreach create_instance nodogsplash`, `files/etc/init.d/nodogsplash`)
and starts one procd instance per `config nodogsplash` section
(`procd_open_instance $cfg`), each with its own generated config file
(`/tmp/etc/nodogsplash_$cfg.conf`, written at `:172`, started at `:189-205`).
Per section it honours
`gatewayinterface` (`:125,139`), `gatewayport`, `ndsctlsocket` and
`fw_mark_{authenticated,trusted,blocked}` (`:141-147`), and those marks really
are per instance (`src/conf.c:154-156,229-231,898-901`). So the *process* layer
can start two gates; the *daemon* cannot isolate their enforcement. Concretely,
with two instances:

- both create the same chains; the second's `iptables -t … -N nds…`
  (`src/fw_iptables.c:442-446,534-538`) collides with the first's;
- **either instance starting or restarting wipes both bridges' enforcement**,
  because `iptables_fw_destroy()` is name-scoped, not interface-scoped — and it
  runs on the start path too (`src/main.c:297-305`). Restarts are not
  hypothetical: procd respawns, the fw4 hotplug restarts the daemon, and this
  module drives `/etc/init.d/nodogsplash start|stop|restart`
  (`src/cmd/tollgate-cli/main.go:705-776`). The silent consequence is *not*
  free internet on the captive bridge — there it is the opposite: with the
  marking jumps gone, `br-lan` traffic is unmarked and `20-nds-enforce.nft:33`
  (`iifname "br-lan" oifname != "br-lan" … reject`, inside `inet fw4`, so it
  outlives the restart — the resilience `31-*.nft:5-7` relies on) **rejects**
  it, so no `br-lan` client gets out, paying or not. The bridge that leaks is
  the *second* one: nothing in the shipped rules matches it once a design (A1)
  gives it a path to `wan`;
- the second instance's gated clients are only marked because the first
  instance's `ndsOUT`/`ndsBLK`/`ndsTRU` chains are what its jump lands in, so
  "who is paying" is no longer per bridge in any checkable way.

**3. This module assumes one gate, in five concrete places.**

- **The one `ndsctl` call site.** `src/valve/valve.go:96-102` runs
  `exec.CommandContext(ctx, "ndsctl", args...)` with **no `-s`**: the default
  control socket (`/tmp/ndsctl.sock`, `src/conf.h:77`), whichever instance owns
  it — and the second instance to start wins that path, because the socket is
  `unlink()`ed before `bind()` (`src/ndsctl_thread.c:111`). `ndsctl` *does* take
  a socket path (`src/ndsctl.c:62,232`); this module never passes one. That one
  function is the only `ndsctl` exec in the non-test tree, and every
  enforcement action goes through it: `authorizeMAC` (`valve.go:201-244`),
  `deauthorizeMAC` (`:281-308`), `GetClientStats` (`:912-961`),
  `CheckClientState` (`:1002-1041`) — the read-only probe the merchant's
  payment pre-flight and its stale-binding reconciliation both use, each
  through a per-merchant test seam (`src/merchant/merchant.go`, `clientProbe`
  and `staleBindings.probe`).
- **Session tracking is keyed by MAC only, never by bridge.** `openGates`,
  `gateEpochs`, `pendingCloseRetries` (`valve.go:125-147`) and
  `m.customerSessions[mac]` (`merchant.go`) carry no interface, so a MAC that
  moves between bridges has one session and no way to say which gate it belongs
  to.
- **The per-MAC sweep.** The usage monitor ticks every 2 s
  (`src/merchant/merchant.go:438`), and the reconciliation walks
  `valve.TrackedGates()` and probes each address with `ndsctl json <mac>`
  (`merchant.go:835`, `:902-906`, cadence `:696-707`). With one socket, every
  probe is answered by one instance.
- **Identity resolution is bridge-agnostic, which is what makes the failure
  quiet.** `/whoami`, `/ln-invoice`, `/balance`, `/usage`, `/session-state`
  (`src/main.go:1538-1558`) all resolve the caller through
  `clientMACFromSocket` (`:848-862`) → `getMacAddress` (`:864-898`), which reads
  the dnsmasq lease file `/tmp/dhcp.leases` (`:793`) and `/proc/net/arp`. Both
  work on any bridge, so a `br-mgmt` client resolves cleanly and can buy; the
  purchase then calls `valve.OpenGate`/`OpenGateUntil`
  (`src/merchant/lightning.go:753,761`) → `ndsctl auth <mac>` → the single
  instance answers `Client <mac> not found.` (the answer this module already
  distinguishes, `valve.go:264-271`) and the money path ends in the
  paid-but-not-granted escalation (`ErrAccessGrantNotApplied`, 503
  `access-grant-failed`).
- **The nft layers are `br-lan`-literal.**
  `20-nds-enforce.nft:22,25,28,33` (`iifname "br-lan"` for the three marks and
  the unmarked-to-WAN reject), `30-backend-firewall.nft:21-22`
  (`iifname != { "br-lan", "lo" } tcp dport 2121 drop` — a client that cannot
  reach `:2121` cannot pay), `31-*.nft:52-53`, `32-*.nft:54-55`, and the
  zone-scoped `firewall.tollgate_in` rule that allows `:2121` from `lan`
  (`99-tollgate-setup:1427-1441`).

### Where the wired LAN ports are bound, and therefore who may move them

Not this repository, and not the feed recipe — **the base image**.

- This module ships **no** `/etc/config/network` at all (`packaging/files/etc/`
  has no `config/` directory), only **reads** the LAN device
  (`99-tollgate-setup:1517-1519`, `lan_dev=$(uci -q get network.lan.device)`,
  defaulting to `br-lan`), and writes only `network.lan.domain` (`:867`) and
  `network.lan.ip6assign` (`:1463`).
- The feed recipe vendors the same writer (its copy of `99-tollgate-setup`
  carries the same `network.lan.domain`/`ip6assign` writes and no port list).
- The ports come from `/etc/board.d/02_network` at first boot: for this
  hardware `openwrt/openwrt` `openwrt-25.12`
  `target/linux/mediatek/filogic/base-files/etc/board.d/02_network:158-166` —
  `glinet,gl-mt3000` (and `gl-mt2500`, `gl-x3000`, …, and `openwrt,one`) are
  `ucidef_set_interfaces_lan_wan eth1 eth0` — which lands `eth1` as the LAN
  device in `board.json`, and `/bin/config_generate:109-119` turns that into
  `config device` + `option name 'br-lan'` + `list ports 'eth1'`. On a multi-port
  device the same call names `lan1 … lan5`
  (`02_network:98-103`, `glinet,gl-mt6000`).

Consequence: the ports list is **image-owned**, so the module must write the
move itself (it already writes `network` freely, and it already creates
`network.private`/`network.private_bridge` and `dhcp.private` the same way,
`99-tollgate-setup:1693-1707`), and it must do so **device-agnostically** — by
reading the port list that is currently on `br-lan` and moving it, never by
naming `eth1`.

## Decision

**D1 — The wired LAN ports move to a new bridge `br-mgmt`.** A new writer
(`setup_mgmt_bridge` in `99-tollgate-setup`) creates `network.mgmt`
(`proto static`, device `br-mgmt`) and `network.mgmt_bridge`
(`type bridge`, `name br-mgmt`), **moves** every port currently listed on
`br-lan` to it, and commits `network`. The `network device` section is
anonymous — `/bin/config_generate:109-119` emits it without a name — so
`network.@device[br-lan]` is **not valid UCI addressing**: the writer must find
the `@device[N]` whose `option name` is `br-lan` (`uci show network` piped to
`awk`, the idiom already in the script at `99-tollgate-setup:1469`) and move its
`ports` list. If `br-lan` has no port list, the writer **fails loudly and
changes nothing** (a bridge with no ports would leave the operator with a dead
cable and no diagnostic).

**D2 — `br-mgmt` gets its own fw4 zone, and it is a management zone with no way
out.** `firewall.mgmt_zone` (`name 'mgmt'`, `network 'mgmt'`,
`input 'ACCEPT'`) and **no forwarding to `wan`**. It must **not** join
`firewall.private_zone`: that zone is `input/output/forward 'ACCEPT'` and has a
`private → wan` forwarding (`99-tollgate-setup:1734-1743`), i.e. reusing it
would hand every wired client free internet — the exact hole this record exists
to not create. The admin listeners need no change to be reachable: they bind
`0.0.0.0`/`[::]` (`uhttpd.main` `:8080`/`:443`, `99-tollgate-setup:337-339,443-448`;
`uhttpd.portal` `:2051`, `:364-365`; `uhttpd.trusted` `:80`, `:646-648`;
`:8090` written here on `uhttpd.net4sats`/configUI, `:689-709`, and the opt-in
`:8443` on `uhttpd.admin` written by the feed's `92-tollgate-admin-setup` —
this script only clears that listener, `:804-805`).

**D3 — `br-mgmt` serves DHCP.** `dhcp.mgmt` (`interface 'mgmt'`), so the
operator's laptop gets an address and the router has a lease to resolve it by —
the same shape as `dhcp.private` (`:1703-1707`).

**D4 — `br-mgmt` is positively scoped: admin surfaces only.** An input fragment
for `br-mgmt` accepts DHCP/DNS, SSH and the four admin ports
(`443, 8080, 8090, 8443`) and **drops everything else**, counter-tagged. This is
deliberately an allow list and not a blacklist, because it has to carry a
property a blacklist cannot state:

**D5 — The customer/payment surfaces do not exist on `br-mgmt`.** `:2050`,
`:2051` and `:2121` are **not** on the `br-mgmt` allow list. A network this
module cannot gate must not be able to buy: as shown in Context, a `br-mgmt`
client resolves a MAC, can be sold a session, and the grant then fails in the
single instance's `ndsctl` — money taken, nothing delivered, `access_granted`
false. Blocking the payment surface is the only honest state until a real second
gate exists (F1/F2 below).

**D6 — Exactly one nodogsplash instance, pinned.** `setup_nodogsplash` keeps
writing `nodogsplash.@nodogsplash[0].gatewayinterface='br-lan'`
(`99-tollgate-setup:1214`) and `assert_nodogsplash_allow_entries` keeps writing
one `users_to_router` list (`:1108-1124`). No second `config nodogsplash`
section is ever created, by any shipped writer. This is stated as an invariant
with a drift guard because it is the one change that would look like it
implements this request while breaking the gate (see rejected alternative A1).

**D7 — The two guards and the enforcement fragment keep their scope, and are
pinned to it.** `31-*.nft`, `32-*.nft` and `20-nds-enforce.nft` keep matching
`iifname "br-lan"` and must **never** be extended to `br-mgmt`: a `br-mgmt`
client is not a guest, and the reason the admin ports may be reachable there is
that the bridge holds no stranger. The guest APs stay bound to
`network=lan` (`99-tollgate-setup:1014`), so the open SSID keeps the guards.

**D8 — The requirement's paywall half is explicitly not delivered here.** The
wired bridge is a management bridge: it reaches the administration surfaces
before any payment, and it reaches nothing else, including the internet. See
below for what it would take to make it a second *paywalled* network, and why
that is not this change.

### The half that cannot work as specified

**The stack cannot gate two bridges at once, so "admin surfaces pre-auth *and*
still captured by the gate and paywall on the same bridge" cannot be delivered
by configuration.** One nodogsplash process manages one interface
(`src/conf.h:146`), its iptables chains are fixed, shared names in one network
namespace (`src/fw_iptables.h:35-44`) and its teardown deletes them by name
(`src/fw_iptables.c:689-747`); this module drives exactly one control socket
(`valve.go:96-102`). Two instances are startable (procd, one per uci section)
and unsafe: either one restarting removes the other's enforcement, and the
money path can only ever talk to one of them.

Since one gate gates one L2 domain, and the pre-auth allow list
(`users_to_router`, `99-tollgate-setup:1108-1124`) is a property of the gate,
**the pre-auth policy of a captive network and its bridge are the same thing**.
Two different pre-auth policies therefore need two gates, and the shipped stack
has one. Every design that pretends otherwise is either (a) a second instance
(rejected, A1), (b) a per-client discriminator on the one gated bridge
(rejected for the shipped case, A2 — it reintroduces the guest hole for a MAC
spoofer), or (c) not gating the second bridge at all (this proposal).

What follows from that, stated for the operator rather than implied:

- **what he gets now**: his cable reaches `:8080`/`:443` and `:8090`/`:8443`
  before paying anything, on a bridge no stranger shares, and the open guest
  SSID is unchanged — same guards, same paywall, same portal;
- **what he does not get now**: a wired *customer* network. A wired client
  cannot buy internet on `br-mgmt`, and D5 stops it from trying. Internet is
  bought on the gated wireless network, as today;
- **what it would take** to have both, as two follow-ups, neither of which is a
  configuration change:
  - **F1 (preferred): per-instance isolation upstream.** Make nodogsplash's
    chain names and destroy path per instance (suffix the `nds*` names by pid or
    interface — `fw_iptables.h:35-44`,
    `fw_iptables.c:442-446,534-538,689-747`), give
    each instance its own `ndsctlsocket` (already a per-section uci option,
    init script `:141-147`), and teach `valve.go:96-102` to select the socket of
    the bridge the client is on (the bridge is knowable: `/proc/net/arp` carries
    the device, `main.go:887-895`). That is a nodogsplash change plus a small
    module change, and it keeps **one** enforcement authority.
  - **F2: a second, module-owned gate.** The nft-sets/`policy drop` design
    already specified for host mode (a `forward` chain that owns its drop
    policy, per-MAC accept sets, counters) extended to a second bridge, with
    `valve` growing a second backend. Bigger, and it creates a second way to be
    free — a second enforcement implementation that can disagree with the first.

  Only after F1 or F2 may `br-mgmt` be a captive network, and only then may
  `:2050/:2051/:2121` (`30-backend-firewall.nft:21-22`) be opened to it.

**A second bridge being cheaper than a second gate is the whole point.** D1
alone removes the lockout and the L2 exposure; it does not sell anything.

## Invariants

1. **One gated bridge.** Exactly one `config nodogsplash` section exists, and
   its `gatewayinterface` is the captive bridge the guest APs are bound to.
2. **No admin surface is guest-reachable.** `:8080/:443` and `:8090/:8443`
   remain dropped on the captive bridge for both families, for authenticated and
   unauthenticated clients alike — i.e. `31-*.nft:52-53` and `32-*.nft:54-55`
   are unchanged, and no shipped writer adds those ports to
   `users_to_router`.
3. **`br-mgmt` has no path off the router.** No forwarding to `wan` from the
   `mgmt` zone, no nodogsplash involvement, no marks.
4. **`br-mgmt` cannot transact.** The payment surface (`:2050`, `:2051`,
   `:2121`) is unreachable from it while the stack can gate only one bridge.
5. **Nothing about the guest path changes.** The guest APs stay on the captive
   bridge, the portal, `:80` stub and pre-auth list are untouched.

## Consequences

### Positive

- The operator's reported lockout ends, without weakening a single guard: the
  admin surfaces answer on a bridge that holds only his own devices.
- The wired port leaves the guest's L2 domain — the exposure
  `99-tollgate-setup:974-993` recorded as unfixable by bridge-port isolation,
  using the mechanism that comment itself named.
- The customer path is untouched: the portal, the pre-auth list, the paywall of
  the wireless network and the two guards keep their present behaviour, so none
  of the pre18 release's measured assertions move.
- The change is small and reversible: new UCI sections plus one uci-defaults
  writer and one nft fragment, no Go changes, no portal changes.

### Costs and what the operator gives up

- **A wired client has no internet at all**, only the administration surfaces.
  This is a deliberate consequence of "one gate", not an oversight: it is what
  makes D5 honest. If the operator wants a wired network that sells internet,
  that is F1/F2, not a wider allow list.
- **The cutover is a moment of no-cable-access.** The writer runs from the full
  setup path; until `br-mgmt` is up the wired client has nothing. The private
  SSID and the module CLI remain the way back in
  (`31-*.nft:38-42`, `32-*.nft:32-40` name those two paths).
- **The port list is image-owned** (Context). A `sysupgrade -n` or a factory
  reset regenerates it from `02_network:/bin/config_generate`, putting the wired
  port back on `br-lan` until a full setup runs again. The same-version install
  path must re-assert the move for that reason — the writer is idempotent by
  construction, like every other writer in this script.
- **No payment on `br-mgmt` means no test surface there either**: the operator
  cannot reach the portal from the cable to test a purchase. Testing stays on
  the wireless path.
- The later, separately carded feature — a config field that toggles the LAN
  port between `br-mgmt` / `br-private` / the public-guest bridge — is out of
  scope here; D1's writer is written as one place that computes "which bridge
  the wired ports are on", so that field becomes a parameter rather than a
  second implementation. **It now exists**: `tollgate.lan_ports.role` and the
  parameterised writer are `lan-port-role-decision.md`, and this record's D1-D8
  remain the account of the default (`mgmt`) placement and of why the cable
  cannot both reach the admin surfaces and pay.

## Alternatives rejected, and why

### A1 — A second nodogsplash instance for `br-mgmt`

Rejected: **it does not isolate, and its failure mode differs by bridge —
fail-closed on `br-lan`, fail-open on the second one.** The packaging supports
it (one procd instance per `config nodogsplash` section, its own generated
config file, per-section `gatewayinterface`/`ndsctlsocket`/`fw_mark_*`), which
is exactly what makes it attractive — but the daemon has fixed, shared chain
names (`src/fw_iptables.h:35-44`), creates them with `-N` in both tables
(`src/fw_iptables.c:442-446` mangle, `:534-538` filter) and **deletes them by
name** on teardown (`:689-747`), on the start path as well as on shutdown
(`src/main.c:297-305`). Either instance starting or restarting wipes the other's
enforcement, and nothing in either process notices: on `br-lan` every unmarked
client is rejected (Context), and the second bridge is as open as its own zone
leaves it, because nothing in the shipped rules matches it. Restarts are
routine: procd respawn, the fw4 hotplug, and this module's own
`/etc/init.d/nodogsplash restart` (`src/cmd/tollgate-cli/main.go:705-776`).
On top of that the money path is single-socket by construction (`valve.go:96-102`
with no `-s`), so the second instance can never be authorised by `valve` — a
second gate that cannot be opened or closed correctly, and that can silently
stop metering the first one. This is the alternative that "meets the
requirement", and it is the reason this record says the requirement is not
satisfiable as configuration.

### A2 — Keep one bridge, allow the admin ports for the operator's MAC

The cheapest path that functionally satisfies "admin surfaces before paying,
guest still blocked, paywall intact": leave the wired port on the captive bridge,
and add an `ether saddr <operator MAC>` `accept` for `{443, 8080, 8090, 8443}`
ahead of the two guards in `31-*.nft`/`32-*.nft`.

Rejected as the mechanism, and it is worth being precise about how it fails:

- **It re-opens the guest hole to anyone who can spoof.** The guard exists
  because "a customer-facing network must never answer a browser with the
  router's administration login" (`32-*.nft:16-23`), and the surface behind it
  is a root-capable login over cleartext HTTP with rpcd's session endpoint on the
  same origin (`31-*.nft:9-17`). This repo has already measured the premise that
  kills a MAC allow: an authorised MAC "is still harvestable from 802.11
  headers" (`99-tollgate-setup:969-972`). A stranger on the open SSID sets that
  MAC and the drop stops applying — the hole the guards exist to close, opened
  by configuration, with a comment claiming otherwise.
- **No L2 separation.** The operator's administration laptop keeps sharing a
  broadcast domain with strangers, which is the second thing the bridge fixes.
- **It is device-bound.** Privacy MAC rotation, a replacement laptop or a second
  admin device each need a new allow entry, and each stale entry is a standing
  exemption.
- It is nonetheless a **valid interim** if the operator needs admin reach from a
  device that cannot be moved to `br-mgmt` — recorded here so it is not
  rediscovered as a "fix", with the spoofing caveat attached.

### A3 — Leave everything as it is and re-add `:8080/:443/:8090/:8443` to the pre-auth list

Rejected: that is the defect `32-*.nft` was written to fix, measured on the
bench on 2026-09-25 (a paying guest typing `http://<router>/` landed on the LuCI
login). The superseded reachability ADR
(`docs/architecture/luci-https-pre-auth-reachability-decision.md`) documents the
reversal; this record does not undo it.

### A4 — Make remote administration safe instead of bridge-scoping it

Rejected for this decision (and not evaluated on its merits): reaching `:8090`
over cleartext HTTP with a root-capable login behind it is a transport question,
`31-*.nft:9-17` gives its own reasoning for the guard, and reversing it is a
different decision with a different owner. It is noted only so the maintainer can
see it was considered.

### A5 — Leave the wired port on `br-lan` and move the guest SSIDs instead

Rejected: it trades a solved problem for an unsolved one. Whichever bridge the
guests are on is the bridge that needs the guards, the paywall and the portal;
moving them changes the bridge name in a dozen files and the wired port is still
in the same L2 domain as the guests unless it is separated — which is D1.

## What must be true before this ships

Every item is an assertion someone can run; "measured on the bench" is not
evidence for an offline test, and an offline test is not evidence for the
hardware. Both tiers are listed.

**Offline (fake `uci`, no router, no network — the repo's existing tier, e.g.
`tests/uci-defaults-private-subnet_test.sh`, `tests/packaging/luci-not-guest-reachable_test.sh`)**

1. `setup_mgmt_bridge` creates `network.mgmt`, `network.mgmt_bridge`,
   `dhcp.mgmt` and `firewall.mgmt_zone`, and **moves** the port list: after a
   run on a fixture whose `br-lan` device lists `eth1`, `br-lan` lists none and
   `br-mgmt` lists `eth1`. A fixture with an empty `br-lan` port list changes
   nothing and fails loudly. *Not runnable against the existing offline tier as
   it stands*: the shim in `tests/uci-defaults-private-subnet_test.sh:74`
   answers `show` with `:` (a silent no-op), while the repo's own idiom for
   enumerating `network` sections is `uci show network | awk`
   (`99-tollgate-setup:1469`) — a writer using it would see no ports and take
   the fail-loudly branch on every fixture. The implementing PR must teach the
   shim `show`/`get`, or seed flat `network.@device[N].ports` keys in the
   fixture, and prove the negative in the same change (assertion 2).
2. The move is idempotent: a second run adds nothing and duplicates nothing
   (the repo's `uci` shim trap applies — an unhandled verb must not pass
   vacuously).
3. No shipped file gives any uci section other than
   `nodogsplash.@nodogsplash[0]` a `gatewayinterface`; exactly one
   `config nodogsplash` is created on every setup path, and it is `br-lan`.
4. `31-*.nft` and `32-*.nft` still drop their ports on `br-lan` only (protocol
   coverage and both families), and **no** shipped fragment names `br-mgmt` in a
   `drop`/`reject` for those ports.
5. The new `br-mgmt` fragment: `nft -c -f` passes against a `table inet
   fw4 {}` wrapper, with a negative control (a fragment missing the drop must
   fail the check); its allow list contains `443, 8080, 8090, 8443` and its drop
   covers `2050`, `2051` and `2121`. *This harness does not exist in the tree
   today* — `grep -rn "nft -c\|table inet fw4 {"` matches nothing outside this
   record — so the implementing PR must add it (a wrapper file plus the
   `nft -c -f` invocation). The existing fragment tier validates statically
   instead: it greps for the expected rules, checks the fragment opens no
   `table` of its own, and checks it reuses no chain name
   (`tests/packaging/luci-not-guest-reachable_test.sh:90-105`). Adding the
   parser-backed check is this assertion's actual work, not an assumption.
6. `firewall.mgmt_zone` has no forwarding to `wan`, and the writer does not
   reuse `firewall.private_zone`.
7. The same-version (reinstall/upgrade) path reaches the same writer, so a
   router that already has `/etc/tollgate-setup-done` at the current version
   still moves the ports (`tests/uci-defaults-same-version-allowlist_test.sh`
   shows the tier).
8. `make go-battery` from the repo root is unaffected (no Go changes).

**Bench, after the install (GL-MT3000, one owner, artifact identity read back
per the repo's deploy rules)**

9. **The port really moved.** `uci show network | grep -A3 mgmt_bridge` lists
   the wired port; `ip -d link show <wired port>` shows `master br-mgmt` and
   **not** `master br-lan`; `ip -d link show br-lan` does not list it.
10. **Admin surfaces answer from the cable, pre-auth.** From the wired client,
    before any purchase: `:8090` answers (board), `:8080` answers (LuCI) and
    `:443` completes a TLS handshake. `:8443` answers **only when the opt-in
    listener exists** — it is written by the feed's `92-tollgate-admin-setup` and
    this script only clears it (`99-tollgate-setup:804-805`), so on a router with
    no TLS identity there is no listener and a correct build must not be failed
    for its absence. `:22` answers **only if dropbear listens on the `mgmt`
    network**: nothing in `99-tollgate-setup` configures SSH, so that dependency
    has to be named rather than assumed.
11. **The cable has no internet.** From the wired client: `ping 9.9.9.9` fails,
    a TCP connection to a WAN address fails, and the fragment's drop counter
    increments (`nft list chain inet fw4 <mgmt chain>`).
12. **The cable cannot buy.** `:2121`, `:2050`, `:2051` are refused/dropped from
    the wired client (so no Lightning quote and no token can be posted), and no
    `PAID`/`access_granted` event happens for that MAC.
13. **The guest is unchanged.** From a client on the open guest SSID with a MAC
    the router has never seen: `:8090`, `:8443`, `:8080`, `:443` are dropped;
    `:2050`/`:2051` answer; the portal completes a purchase end to end and the
    gate opens (i.e. the paywall still works exactly as on pre18).
14. **One gate.** `uci show nodogsplash` shows one section;
    `pgrep -fc nodogsplash` is 1; `ls -l /tmp/ndsctl*` shows one socket.
15. **`br-mgmt` clients still resolve.** `logread -e dnsmasq` shows a lease for
    the wired client on the `mgmt` network (`getMacAddress`,
    `src/main.go:864-898`); this is what keeps a future F1 implementation
    possible without redesigning identity.
16. **The module still administers the gate from a full round trip**: status,
    `whoami`, a purchase and a session close on the *wireless* path behave as
    they do on pre18 — the wired change must not have touched the money path.
17. **Recovery**: with the cable moved, the private SSID and the module CLI
    still reach the box (the two documented recovery paths), and re-running the
    full setup converges without duplicating sections.

`docs/rc-tester-guide.md` §7 must be updated in the same change: it currently
tells a tester that `tcp 8090/8443` are dropped for "a wired-LAN or guest-SSID
client" and that this is the guard, not TLS. After this change that is true of a
**guest-SSID** client and of a `br-lan` client, and false of the wired client,
which now reaches the board and LuCI and has no internet.

## Rollout / PR sequence

1. **This document** (docs-only): the decision, the evidence, the rejected
   alternatives, and the assertion list.
2. **The bridge and its scope** (one PR): the `setup_mgmt_bridge` writer plus the
   `br-mgmt` fragment, the pinning tests, the `docs/rc-tester-guide.md` §7
   correction, and a `CHANGELOG.md` entry under `Changed / Internal`.
3. **Bench measurement, then the release cut.** The pre18 assertions must be
   re-measured on the build that carries this change before any feed bump
   (assertions 9-17 above), because two of them — 11 and 12 — are the difference
   between "the operator can administer his router" and "a stranger has free
   internet".
4. **Then, separately, F1 or F2** if a *paywalled* wired network is still
   wanted. That decision is not made here, and `br-mgmt` must not be described
   as a customer network until it lands.

## Notes

- **Provenance of the external evidence.** The daemon citations are the
  nodogsplash `v5.0.2` tag (`src/conf.h`, `src/conf.c`, `src/fw_iptables.h`,
  `src/fw_iptables.c`, `src/ndsctl.c`, `src/ndsctl_thread.c`) — the version this
  repo names in its own comments (`20-nds-enforce.nft:3`, `CHANGELOG.md`) and
  the version `openwrt/packages` `net/nodogsplash/Makefile` builds
  (`PKG_VERSION:=5.0.2`). The OpenWrt-init-script citations are that package's
  `files/etc/init.d/nodogsplash`, which on 2026-09-26 exists **only on the
  packages feed's `master`** (`net/nodogsplash` is absent from
  `openwrt-25.12` and `openwrt-24.10`, verified by tree listing), so a router
  running it got it from `master` or from a vendored copy. Nothing in this
  record depends on a version newer than the one shipped: the single-interface,
  fixed-chain, single-socket facts above are all v5.0.2 facts.
- **Why this is an ADR and not a config change.** The repo's rule is decision
  first (`docs/architecture/`), and this one has a fact in it the requester did
  not have: the request as worded cannot be satisfied by the stack as built. The
  right time to learn that is before the change, not from a router whose gate has
  been torn down on one bridge and left absent on the other.
- **What is unchanged, deliberately**: `users_to_router` (`99-tollgate-setup:1108-1124`),
  the `:8080`/`:443` removal logic, the `:80` trusted stub
  (`setup_uhttpd_trusted_entry`), `20-nds-enforce.nft`'s mark values
  (`0x10000`/`0x20000`/`0x30000`) and its `br-lan` scope, the two guards, and
  `firewall.tollgate_in`'s `:2121` rule. A reader looking for a diff in those
  files should find none.
- **The `:2121` ACL is the marker of a paywalled network.**
  `30-backend-firewall.nft:21-22` allows payments only from `br-lan` and `lo`.
  Whoever opens F1/F2 must add their new bridge to that set in the same commit,
  with the guard that a bridge added there is a bridge that sells.
- **The one-line summary for a maintainer**: the wired ports can have a bridge
  of their own, that bridge can reach the administration surfaces before
  paying, and it cannot also be a network that sells internet — not with one
  nodogsplash, and not with two instances on one router.
