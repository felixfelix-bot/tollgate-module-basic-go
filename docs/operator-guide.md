# Operator Guide

Practical reference for running a TollGate router day-to-day. Every
command below is typed into the router shell over SSH (or a serial
console). The `tollgate` binary ships inside the `tollgate-wrt`
package and talks to the running service over a Unix domain socket at
`/var/run/tollgate.sock`.

> **Prerequisite:** the TollGate service must be running. If it is not,
> commands that route through the socket report
> `failed to communicate with TollGate service`. Start it with
> `tollgate start` (or `/etc/init.d/tollgate-wrt start`).

## Service management

### Status

```sh
tollgate status
```

Reports whether the service is running, its version and uptime, and
whether the config, wallet, and upstream-network subsystems are
healthy:

```
running: true
version: v0.5.0
uptime: 4h12m
config_ok: true
wallet_ok: true
network_ok: true
```

`network_ok` reflects the upstream connectivity probe, not the private
Wi-Fi radio state.

### Start / stop / restart

```sh
tollgate start     # starts NoDogSplash first, then tollgate-wrt
tollgate stop      # stops tollgate-wrt first, then NoDogSplash
tollgate restart   # restarts both in start order
```

These wrap the OpenWrt init scripts
(`/etc/init.d/nodogsplash`, `/etc/init.d/tollgate-wrt`). Stopping the
service does **not** kick off connected customers immediately —
NoDogSplash keeps existing authorisations until their MAC entries
expire — but no new sessions can be purchased while the service is
down.

### Health

```sh
tollgate health
```

A lighter check than `status`: prints `status: ok`, the config/wallet
flags, and uptime. If the socket is unreachable it reports
`Service not reachable` and exits non-zero, making it suitable for a
monitoring cron job:

```sh
# example: alert if the service is down
tollgate health >/dev/null 2>&1 || echo "TollGate is DOWN on $(date)"
```

### Version

```sh
tollgate version
```

```
TollGate Version
version: v0.5.0
commit: a1b2c3d
build_time: 2026-07-03T10:00:00Z
go_version: go1.23.0
openwrt_version: OpenWrt 24.10.0
```

### Logs

```sh
tollgate logs            # all TollGate log lines
tollgate logs -n 50      # last 50 lines
tollgate logs -f         # follow (like tail -f)
tollgate logs -n 100 -f  # last 100, then follow
```

This wraps `logread -e tollgate`, so it captures every line the
service writes via syslog. For a raw, unfiltered view of everything
on the router (useful when debugging NoDogSplash or DHCP alongside
TollGate), use `logread` directly:

```sh
logread -f
```

## Wallet operations

The wallet holds Cashu ecash across one or more mints. Customers pay
into it; the payout routine sweeps profits to configured Lightning
addresses on a per-mint schedule.

### Check balance

```sh
tollgate wallet balance
```

```
Total wallet balance: 1284 sats
```

This is the sum across **all** mints that currently hold funds,
including mints no longer listed in `accepted_mints`.

### Detailed wallet info

```sh
tollgate wallet info
```

```
Wallet info - Total: 1284 sats across 2 mints
  mint_balances:
    https://mint.coinos.io: 900
    https://mint.minibits.cash: 384
  mint_count: 2
  total_balance: 1284
```

Only mints with a non-zero balance are shown. Use this when you need
to see *where* the funds sit (e.g. before draining or when
investigating a per-mint payout failure).

### Fund the wallet

```sh
# with the token as an argument
tollgate wallet fund cashuA...

# or interactively (the CLI prompts and reads from stdin)
tollgate wallet fund
Paste your Cashu token: <paste token>
```

The token is sent to the service, which decodes it, swaps it with the
mint to verify the proofs are unspent, and stores the new proofs. On
success:

```
Successfully funded wallet with 500 sats
```

This is the same receive path customer payments take, so it also
works for topping up from an external Cashu wallet.

### Drain funds

```sh
tollgate wallet drain cashu
```

**This removes ALL funds from the wallet.** The CLI prints a warning
and asks for confirmation:

```
⚠️  WARNING: Draining the wallet will remove ALL funds from the wallet!
The funds will be converted to Cashu tokens that will be saved to a file.
Once drained, the tokens are OUT of the wallet and must be stored securely.

Are you sure you want to drain the wallet? (y/N):
```

After confirmation, every mint with a balance is drained into a
separate Cashu token. The tokens are written to a timestamped file
(`wallet_drain_2026-07-05_14-30-00.txt`) in the current directory and
also printed to the terminal:

```
Wallet Drain Results:
====================
Total drained: 1284 sats

✓ Tokens saved to: wallet_drain_2026-07-05_14-30-00.txt

Token 1:
  Mint: https://mint.coinos.io
  Balance: 900 sats
  Token: cashuA...

Token 2:
  Mint: https://mint.minibits.cash
  Balance: 384 sats
  Token: cashuA...
```

For scripts and other non-interactive callers, `--yes` (or `-y`)
skips the confirmation prompt:

```sh
tollgate wallet drain cashu --yes
```

Draining each mint is an independent, irreversible operation. If one
mint's drain fails after another's succeeded, the command reports a
**partial** result: it prints and saves the tokens that were produced,
lists the per-mint failures, and exits non-zero. Check the output
carefully — a partial drain means some funds left the wallet as tokens
while others stayed in it.

Every successfully produced token is also appended (before the next
mint is attempted) to `/etc/tollgate/wallet-drain-journal.jsonl`, an
append-only safety copy in case the terminal session or the device is
lost before the tokens are secured. Sweep and clear that file the same
way you treat the drain output.

Cancellation and failure are distinguishable from success by exit
code: `0` only when the whole drain succeeded; a declined or
unanswerable prompt (e.g. stdin at EOF) and any full or partial drain
failure exit non-zero.

Treat the output file as cash — anyone who reads a token string can
spend it. Copy it somewhere safe and delete the plaintext once
redeemed.

> Lightning drain (`tollgate wallet drain lightning`) is not yet
> implemented; only `cashu` is supported.

## Private network management

The private Wi-Fi is the network *you* (the operator) connect to,
distinct from the captive-portal guest network. Commands operate on
both the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz private interfaces simultaneously; the
radios are found by band, not by section name (which radio is 2.4 GHz
varies between routers). If the router has no radio for one of the
bands, that band's steps log a warning and are skipped.

### View current settings

```sh
tollgate network private status
```

```
Private Network Configuration
=============================
SSID:     MyTollGate
Password: correct-horse-battery-09
Status:   Enabled
```

### Enable / disable

```sh
tollgate network private enable
tollgate network private disable
```

Disabling shows a lockout warning and requires confirmation, because
turning off the private Wi-Fi can cut off your only wireless access to
the router:

```
⚠️  WARNING: Disabling the private network may lock you out of the router!
Make sure you have another way to access the router (e.g., via the public
network or physical access).

Are you sure you want to disable the private network? (y/N):
```

### Rename the SSID

```sh
tollgate network private rename MyNewNetwork
```

Changes the SSID on both radios and reloads wireless immediately. Any
device currently connected to the old SSID will be disconnected.

### Change the password

```sh
# set a specific password (must be 8–63 characters for WPA2)
tollgate network private set-password "my-new-password"

# generate a random human-readable password instead
tollgate network private set-password
```

When no password is given, a random one is generated in the form
`Word-Word-Word-NN` (e.g. `Alpha-Bravo-Charlie-42`) using a
cryptographic random source. The new password is printed back so you
can record it:

```
Private network password changed successfully
  new_password: Alpha-Bravo-Charlie-42
```

## Upstream WiFi management

Upstream Wi-Fi is how the router reaches the internet — either from
an ISP router, a mobile hotspot, or another TollGate in reseller
mode. See [docs/wireless_gateway_manager.md](wireless_gateway_manager.md)
for the background daemon that automates this; the commands below are
for manual control.

### Scan

```sh
tollgate upstream scan
```

Scans all radios and lists visible networks sorted by signal. Each entry
also reports the band of the radio that scanned it, so a 2.4 GHz SSID can
be told apart from a 5 GHz one without assuming radio0 is 2.4 GHz:

```
SSID                             Signal    Ch     Encryption           Radio  Band
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HomeFibre                        -42 dBm   36     WPA2                radio1 5g
TollGate-Cafe                    -55 dBm   6      WPA2                radio0 2g
OpenGuest                        -67 dBm   11     none                radio0 2g
```

### Connect

```sh
tollgate upstream connect HomeFibre "my-wifi-password"
tollgate upstream connect OpenGuest        # no password needed for open networks
```

Connection runs as a **streaming** operation with live progress so you
can see where it stalls:

```
  [1/7] Enabling radios...
  [2/7] Scanning for 'HomeFibre'...
  [3/7] Found 'HomeFibre' (-42 dBm on radio1) encryption=psk2
  [4/7] Setting up wwan interface...
  [5/7] Creating STA upstream_homefibre on radio1...
  [6/7] Switching upstream... waiting for DHCP
  [7/7] Connected to 'HomeFibre' via upstream_homefibre (-42 dBm on radio1)
```

The command picks the radio with the best signal for the target SSID,
creates a STA interface, and switches the upstream to it. The previous
upstream (if any) is disabled but kept in config as a fallback
candidate. After a manual connect, the background connectivity-check
daemon is **paused** for `manual_pause_seconds` (default 120 s) so it
does not immediately fight your choice.

If the SSID is not found in the scan, you get
`SSID '<name>' not found in scan` — scan again or move closer.

### List configured upstreams

```sh
tollgate upstream list
```

```
SSID                STATUS     RADIO      ENCRYPTION
-------------------------------------------------------
HomeFibre           ACTIVE     radio1     psk2
OldUpstream         disabled   radio0     psk2
```

`ACTIVE` is the interface currently providing upstream; `disabled`
entries are retained as fallback candidates.

### Remove an upstream

```sh
tollgate upstream remove OldUpstream
```

Removes a **disabled** STA section from the wireless config. Active
upstreams cannot be removed — disable or switch away first. This is
housekeeping: removing an entry does not affect connectivity, it just
stops the daemon from ever considering that SSID again.

## Configuration management

TollGate stores its configuration in `/etc/tollgate/config.json` and
identities in `/etc/tollgate/identities.json`. See the
[Configuration](../README.md#configuration) section of the README for
the full schema and an abridged example.

### View configuration

```sh
tollgate config get
```

Prints both the current config and identities. The output mirrors
what is on disk after the last successful save/reload.

### Set a single value

```sh
tollgate config set <key> <value>
```

Keys are **dot-paths** into the JSON document. The change is validated
against the schema and persisted to disk immediately:

```sh
tollgate config set metric milliseconds        # sell time instead of data
tollgate config set step_size 44040192         # adjust the billing unit
tollgate config set accepted_mints.0.price_per_step 2   # index into an array
tollgate config set show_setup false           # booleans accepted as-is
```

The CLI confirms the write, then reminds you to restart:

```
Set metric = milliseconds (restart tollgate-wrt to apply)
```

Most `config set` changes take effect only after
`tollgate restart` (or `/etc/init.d/tollgate-wrt restart`), because
the running service reads the file at startup.

### Inspect the schema

```sh
tollgate config schema
```

Outputs the full machine-readable schema for both `config` and
`identities` — every field, its type, default, and validation rules.
Use this to discover valid keys and values before calling
`config set`.

### Replace the entire config

```sh
tollgate config save '{"config_version":"v0.0.7","metric":"bytes",...}'
tollgate config save-identities '{"identities":[...]}'
```

These write the complete JSON document in one shot. The config
variant validates required fields (`config_version`, `metric`,
`step_size`, `accepted_mints`, `profit_share`) and checks that
`profit_share` factors sum correctly before writing. Prefer
`config set` for individual changes; use `save` only when provisioning
a router from a known-good template.

Both commands reload the in-memory config after writing, but a restart
is still needed for the change to take full effect.

## JSON output

Every command accepts a global `--json` (or `-j`) flag. With it, the
CLI emits structured JSON instead of the human-readable tables, and
destructive commands (`wallet drain cashu`,
`network private disable`) **skip their confirmation prompts** and act
immediately — this is intentional, so the flag can drive automation:

```sh
# script-friendly balance check
tollgate --json wallet balance

# drain without a prompt (tokens go to stdout, no file is written)
tollgate --json wallet drain cashu

# health probe for a monitoring loop
tollgate --json health
```

When the service is unreachable, `--json` output still includes a
`success: false` object with an `error` field rather than printing
prose to stderr, so a wrapper script can parse the failure reliably —
and the process exits non-zero whenever the reported result is a
failure (full or partial), so exit-code checks and JSON parsing agree.
A `wallet drain cashu` response with `"success": false` may still
carry a `"tokens"` array inside `data`: those tokens were produced
irreversibly and belong to you — persist them before investigating the
`errors` entries.

## Client identity, MAC addresses, and what changing one does

TollGate has no accounts and no user identifiers: a customer is identified
by the MAC address their device uses on your Wi-Fi. Sessions, byte meters
and open gates are all keyed by it, and it is the address `ndsctl` is
asked to authorise. Nothing anywhere in the stack takes that identity from
a value the client sends — a `?mac=` parameter or a request-body field is
accepted and ignored; the module resolves the address from the request's
source IP through the DHCP lease file and the kernel ARP table, and
refuses the request (`device-unresolved`) rather than guessing when it
cannot.

### What a MAC address is not

It is not an account, not stable, and **not something this router can
change**. A MAC address is the source address of every frame the device
transmits: it is chosen by the device's own operating system and network
card, it is visible to anyone in range, and it can be typed into a query
string by anyone. An access point can only *filter* addresses
(`macfilter`/`maclist`) or force a re-association — and forcing one does
not change the private address a device has saved for that network.

So "TollGate rotates your MAC automatically" is false, and no release has
ever implemented it. If you have repeated it, correct it: the honest claim
is that TollGate does not require address stability, and never ties
anything durable to it.

### What a device does on its own

On many platforms the device changes or randomises the address by itself,
without the customer asking you:

| Platform | Default | How a customer changes it |
|---|---|---|
| iOS / iPadOS 18+ | "Fixed" on a network with WPA2 or stronger, **"Rotating"** on a weak or open one — which is the usual captive-portal SSID, where it moves to a different private address about every two weeks with no user action | Settings → Wi-Fi → (i) next to the network → "Private Wi-Fi Address" → Off / Fixed / Rotating |
| Android 10+ | One randomised address per network, stable while that network is saved | Settings → Network & internet → Internet → (gear) → "Privacy" |
| Windows 10/11 | Randomisation off unless enabled per network | Settings → Network & internet → Wi-Fi → the network → "Random hardware addresses" |
| Linux (NetworkManager) | `preserve` — the hardware address | `nmcli con mod <id> wifi.cloned-mac-address random` |

A WPA2 password therefore has a side effect worth knowing: it keeps iOS on
a fixed address. An open SSID (the classic captive-portal posture) is
where rotation happens by itself.

### What happens when the address changes mid-session

The session belongs to the address it was bought on, so:

* The device returns as a new client and the portal offers the buy flow
  again.
* The **abandoned** address is not reconciled a minute later: the address
  itself keeps the access NoDogSplash already granted it for about an hour.
  NoDogSplash only stops listing an authenticated client when its idle
  timeout fires, and TollGate ships `authidletimeout='3600'`, so a departed
  client stays listed — and NDS-authorised — for roughly that hour. From the
  first sweep after the listing goes away the module asks NoDogSplash whether
  that client is still there, and after two consecutive "gone" answers —
  within ~30–90 s — it deauthorises the address, drops its session record,
  and clears its metering baseline. The honest end-to-end bound is therefore
  about an hour (NDS listing lifetime) plus a minute (module reconciliation),
  not a minute. That is what stops an address nobody holds from staying
  authorised indefinitely, which anyone who later holds it (a
  hardware-address fallback, a spoof, a collision) would otherwise inherit
  for free.
* The leftover time or data the customer paid for does **not** travel to
  the new address yet: entitlement still belongs to the address. Carrying
  it across needs a session ticket and a portal change, and is scheduled as
  its own change.

Tell customers that plainly, rather than promising seamless roaming:
*changing your device's Wi-Fi address ends your current session.*

### What you will see in the log

```
WARNING: NoDogSplash no longer lists <mac> (1/2 passes) — its binding stays authorised for now
Reconciled the stale binding of <mac>: its client is gone, the gate is deauthorised and the session is retired (12 MB of covered usage; ...)
```

Only a *confirmed* close retires anything. If `ndsctl deauth` fails you
will see the escalation instead — `ERROR: could not close the gate of the
stale binding of <mac> … (unconfirmed gate closes=N)` — and the module
keeps the record and keeps retrying, because a gate that is still open must
stay owned by something. The same rule applies to a customer who is merely
idle: a client NoDogSplash still lists is never touched.

That last rule is also the limit of this pass, and worth knowing: if
NoDogSplash keeps listing an address whose device has left (rather than
dropping the entry), the module cannot tell that address from a customer
who is simply idle, and it leaves it alone on purpose — cutting off a
paying customer is the worse failure. Closing that residue is the job of
the session-ticket work, which re-binds entitlement explicitly instead of
inferring it from an address.

### Rule: never allow-list MAC addresses

Because any client can present any address (and on an open SSID many
devices change theirs by themselves), a MAC allow-list is not an access
control — it hands internet to whoever names an allowed address. Keep the
per-MAC controls you *do* have (session state, byte meters) as accounting,
not as authorisation.

## Troubleshooting

### "failed to communicate with TollGate service"

The Unix socket `/var/run/tollgate.sock` is not accepting
connections. The service is either stopped or crashed.

```sh
tollgate start                                    # or:
/etc/init.d/tollgate-wrt restart
tollgate health                                   # verify it came back
```

If it keeps crashing, check the logs:

```sh
tollgate logs -n 100
logread -e tollgate -f
```

### QR scanner says "make sure you have a camera"

The captive-portal QR scanner needs a **secure context** (HTTPS or
`localhost`) to access the camera via `getUserMedia()`. Captive
portals are served over plain HTTP, so browsers such as Brave and
Firefox on Linux block camera access entirely.

Workaround: skip the scanner and **paste the Cashu token manually**
into the portal input field, or fund the wallet from the router shell
with `tollgate wallet fund <token>`. On Chrome/Edge the scanner
usually works; on the routers where SSL/HTTPS is configured for the
captive portal domain, camera access may also succeed.

### Mint connectivity / payouts not happening

Payouts run on a per-mint timer and only fire when the balance exceeds
`min_payout_amount`. If payouts seem stuck:

```sh
tollgate wallet info                              # is there a balance to pay out?
tollgate config get                               # check payout thresholds per mint
logread -e tollgate | grep -i payout              # look for payout errors
logread -e tollgate | grep -i "Could not find"    # missing identity / Lightning addr
```

Common causes: the mint is unreachable (network issue), the profit
share references an identity not in `identities.json`, or the balance
is below `min_payout_amount` / `min_balance`.

### Private Wi-Fi not visible after enable

```sh
tollgate network private status                   # confirm it says Enabled
wifi reload                                       # force a wireless reload
logread -e hostapd                                # check the AP daemon
```

If the 5 GHz interface is in client (STA) mode for an upstream, it
cannot also serve as a private AP — this is a hardware limitation of
single-radio setups, not a bug.

### Upstream connect fails at "waiting for DHCP"

The STA interface was created and switched to, but the upstream router
did not hand out a lease within the DHCP timeout
(`dhcp_timeout_seconds`, default 180 s).

```sh
tollgate upstream scan                            # is the SSID still visible?
logread -e odhcp                                  # DHCP client logs
```

Try moving closer to the access point, verifying the password, or
checking that the upstream router is not out of DHCP leases.

### A customer paid but has no access, and was shown a reference

When the mint does not answer a payment within its 30-second deadline the
module does not claim the payment failed. It says the outcome is
**unknown** and shows the customer a **reference**: 16 hex characters,
the salted fingerprint of the note they sent. (The note itself is never
written to a log — anyone holding it can spend it — so the reference is
the only handle that ties the customer to the attempt.)

Search the log for it:

```sh
logread -e tollgate | grep '<reference the customer showed you>'
```

The reference appears on the deadline line and again on the line that
answers the question you actually have — what the mint did with the note:

- `late Receive COMPLETED … amount=N — the mint took the note and no
  session was granted; credit or refund it` — the customer's value is in
  the operator wallet and they received nothing. **Nothing credits or
  refunds this automatically today**, so settle it by hand, explicitly
  (grant the device access, or return the value to an address the
  customer controls) and note what you did.
- `late Receive FAILED (outcome still ambiguous) …: <error> — the mint may
  have taken the note; check the wallet balance for the mint before
  resubmitting anything, no session was granted` — the late answer was not
  the mint saying "no". This is what a timeout or another unreachable-class
  error looks like, and it is the **common** case rather than the odd one:
  the module's deadline and the wallet's own HTTP client both run on 30
  seconds, so the first answer to arrive late is normally a client-side one
  that says nothing about what the mint did with the note. **Do not tell the
  customer to send it again.** Check the mint's balance for the amount first;
  if the note was credited, settle it by hand as in the `COMPLETED` case
  above; invite a resubmission only once you have established the mint did
  not take it.
- `late Receive FAILED …: <mint error> — the mint did not take the note, no
  session was granted` — the mint itself refused the note, and a refusal is
  the one answer only the mint can give: the proofs were already spent
  elsewhere, they sit on a retired keyset, they cannot cover the swap fee, or
  the request was rejected outright. The note was never spent. The customer
  can safely submit it again.

If you see only the `Receive outcome unknown` line, the money-moving
request had not finished when you looked — or the process was restarted
while it was in flight, in which case no outcome line will ever be
written. Re-check the log before telling the customer anything. The
durable journal that would settle a late outcome automatically is not

## `TOLLGATE_TEST_CONFIG_DIR` — test-only, and loud if set

The `TOLLGATE_TEST_CONFIG_DIR` environment variable exists for the test
harness: it redirects the config directory, the drain journal
(`/etc/tollgate/wallet-drain-journal.jsonl` — **bearer tokens**) and the
CLI socket to a temp directory. It is meant to be set only by `go test`.

If it appears in a service drop-in, wrapper script or shell profile on a
router, state silently splits: the drain journal lands elsewhere (0600,
but wherever the variable points) while anything not sharing the
environment still uses the stock paths. Both the service and the CLI now
print a `WARNING: TOLLGATE_TEST_CONFIG_DIR is set` line whenever they
honor it — if you see that line in `logread` on a production router,
remove the variable from the environment and move the journal back.
